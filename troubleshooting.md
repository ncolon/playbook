Red Hat’s OpenShift Container Platform sits as the core of our [Hybrid Cloud Strategy](https://www.ibm.com/roadmaps/hybrid-cloud/), and serves
as the foundation for all our Cloud Pak deployments. As our customers embark on their
modernization journey, they are often met with a platform that they may not be familiar with.
They are used to managing their applications in a traditional environment, where they can
access virtual machines directly, and have established processes and procedures in place to
diagnose and remediate any issues they may find. As they move to a Kubernetes based platform
like Red Hat OpenShift, they may not have the necessary skills to properly diagnose issues with
their applications, or even the platform itself. It is therefore essential that we help our
customers increase their skills in managing and maintaining OpenShift, and we enable them to
become more self-sufficient.
Red Hat has published a [consolidated troubleshooting guide](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4217411) to address many of these issues.
Within this article, you will find articles on general troubleshooting, troubleshooting OpenShift
components, How To articles, and FAQs. I’m including the topics covered in this guide below,
since many do not have access to Red Hat’s Knowledge Base. Keep reading for instructions on
how to obtain access.

## Accessing Red Hat Knowledge Base

These articles are hosted behind Red Hat's subscription-based Knowledge
Base. Cloud Pak customers are considered Red Hat paid subscribers and as
a result, your customer should have access to all the content in the
Knowledge Base already. As CSMs, we can create a Red Hat ID and join the
IBM Partner account to gain access to the Knowledge Base. Instructions
are provided [in
Seismic](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCWfXWHpFXTRgGhWRDhTQpTbPDp8)
on how to do this.

## Call To Action

Please share Red Hat's [consolidated troubleshooting
guide](https://access.redhat.com/articles/4217411) with your customers.
It will assist them in skilling up on the platform, increase their
ability to self-service their common issues, as well as assist them in
providing more detailed issue reports when they need to open issues with
IBM Support: a ticket with detailed information will be routed to the
right support engineer quickly, and will avoid unnecessary round trips
between customer and support to resolve their issues.
