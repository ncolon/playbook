## What is co-creation?

When you co-create with your client, you jointly create a solution that enables you to innovate and demonstrate value throughout the sales and adoption journey. To get started, you collaborate with the client to discover needs, wants, and limitations to solve their business challenges. Then you can inspire clients with the possibilities and accelerate alignment on the most valuable solution.

When you are aligned on the business challenge or use case, you can define the business outcome and value the client should expect. This focuses the team on aligning the Proof of Experience (PoX) to that expectation.

If you need help from CE, you can request CE work a deployment by entering the request in ISC.

## When do you co-create with your client?

As a CSM, you need to understand what Client Engineering might have delivered to the client in pre-sales as a PoX so you can ensure the business outcome promised is delivered through deployment of the solution. During the post-sales journey, you are responsible for ensuring the solution is delivering the expected business outcomes. This might require additional PoX work as you co-create to fully implement the solution. Additionally, you might require a PoX as you expand the solution to develop new opportunities with the client.
<br/>

A **PoX** can include any of the following: a custom demo, a pre-sales workshop, an architecture accelerator, a POV, or a PoX.<br/>

**Custom demo**: Custom demonstrations are often modified examples that leverage existing IBM demonstration assets available in TechZone with customizations to meet client specific expectations. You can do this in pre-sales or throughout the journey as needed.

**Pre-sales workshop**: Workshops intended to assist in closing an opportunity or may be used post-sales to provide the client a deeper dive into the technology to assist in their implementation.

**Architecture accelerator**: Shows the vision in the technical implementation, negotiate architectural designs, document proposed architectural implementation and review head winds, blockers, environmental complexity, and feasibility of the proposed solution. This is performed by BTS, CE, Partners or the PTS, or a CSM.

**Proof of Value**: A Proof of Value (PoV) is used to identify the value of a solution based on the client’s use cases.  PoV’s transition previous Workshops and Architecture sessions into usable assets. The CE or Partner usually does this with the client and it can take up to 4 weeks.

**MVP**:
This is used when the client wants a workable solution that allows them to see the value of the solution and that they can then use as a starting point when deploying the solution into production.
An MVP is built with minimal investment and features. It's the foundation upon which to iterate to deliver measurable business outcomes. This can take up to 12 weeks and is usually initiated by a CE, who will call on other IBM team cohorts to assist as needed.
