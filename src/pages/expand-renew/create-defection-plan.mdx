## Create a Defection Report

</Column>
</Row>

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Create a Defection Report when your retention plan was not successful and your customer is going to churn.

The defection report is a Success Plan type that provides visibility into why a customer churned or will churn despite plans to mitigate this risk. It follows an unsuccessful Retention Plan, so the defection report should not come as a surprise to your manager.

</Row>

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

## When do I create a Defection Report?

Create a defection report when the desired outcome of a retention plan was not reached and resulted in revenue attrition or customer churn.

Examples:

* Customer experiencing financial disruption<br/>
* Customer expressing frustration<br/>
* Competitive threat (competitive POC, re-architecting, etc.)<br/>
* Product functionality<br/>
* No identified use cases<br/>
* Revenue moving from one entitlement to the other<br/>
* Include specific details on why we were not successful in retaining the customer and/or the cause of attrition.

You should also create a defection report for "Perceived Churn". This is when the customer stops using one entitlement in favor of another. For example, a POC or moving from SaaS to On Prem. Use the defection report to explain where the revenue is moving.

## How do I create a Defection Report in Gainsight?

As you get started, ensure you understand what caused the initial risk (which should be in the retention plan) and explain why it could not be mitigated.

Think through what the desired outcome of the retention plan was. Did you need to identify a use case?  Did you work with other internal stakeholders such as the the annuity team in an attempt to resolve any customer concerns about the renewal?  Were you engaged with other teams at IBM to address the customer's challenges?

Best Practice:  Give your report a descriptive name so that people will know exactly what the plan is about.

## Build the report

A good defection report includes:

- Clear and concise details why previous attempts at mitigating the risk were unsuccessful<br/>
- Reason for the defection (drop down list)<br/>
- Where the workload may be going (if applicable)<br/>
- Did functionality issues impact the defection? (if applicable)<br/>
- How much of the ACV will be lost?<br/>
- Was the entitlement in production? If so, for how long?<br/>

Best Practice: Review the defection report with your manager as a follow up to the retention plan.
