## Prepare

Before approaching the customer, come together as an internal IBM team and debrief. A cross-section of the team should participate in this activity, including the principal/seller. If a Business Partner is involved, be sure to engage them in the discussion as well.  The CSM and delivery team have first-hand experience that sheds light on what is working for the customer and where there might be areas for improvement. They should understand the next steps the customer would be most receptive to or where adjustments in strategy/direction are needed. They use this insight to help the principal/seller progress the customer to the next step.

The IBM team should host a candid and open conversation that harvests the initial insights. The CSM or delivery team needs to share relevant context with the principal/seller before assessing the roadmap with the customer. Ensure the appropriate team members are clear on the goals of the upcoming conversation and plan to attend. 

### Goals

The goals of the conversation are to:

* Discern if it is necessary to pivot from the current MVP or continue. 
* Create, validate, or adjust the customer roadmap.
* Leverage insights and inputs to help define the next step in the journey.

### Key steps

There are several key steps for conducting a roadmap retrospective.


#### Step 1 - Review the business opportunity statement and use case from the recently completed delivery.

Answer the following questions:

* Were metrics captured?
* Was the hypothesis proven? If not, why? 
* Is the business opportunity still valid? If not, then revisit the use case or opportunity statement.
* What did we do well?
* What can we do differently going forward?

**Note:**  Revisiting and potentially changing the business opportunity might require additional <Link to="/use-case-discovery" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>use case discovery</Link>. Revise the business use case statement as needed.


#### Step 2 - Update the assumptions and risks

Assuming the business opportunity is still valid as stated, revisit the assumptions/risks activities from the Use Case Discovery session and design thinking workshops, as relevant.

* What assumptions/risks were addressed?
* Are there any new assumptions/risks to articulate?  
* After the most recent MVP hypothesis has been tested, what are the next greatest assumptions about achieving the original business opportunity?  Note that assumptions can be technical, but they can also be about expected business outcomes.
* Any assumption that is incorrect is a risk. The greatest assumption and the greatest risk should be the focus of the next MVP. As each MVP in the roadmap addresses the next greatest risk, confidence increases in achieving the original business opportunity.


#### Step 3 - Visualize the updated roadmap

Take the opportunity to work with your customer on an updated roadmap. One approach is to use a cone divided in three sections (as shown below), which can be helpful to plot the next steps with your customer. Use arrows to link initiatives together or to show interdependencies.

The goals of visualizing the roadmap include:

* Balancing the team's focus between the customer's business goals today and in the future using the middle section to stitch the two together.
* Articulating progression to ever increasing value.
* Creating a shared understanding of the path toward a healthy, long-term customer and IBM relationship.
* Understanding if the customer's roadmap includes strategic IBM products.
* Understanding if the customer's roadmap aligns with IBM's technical strategy.

When reviewing your customer's updated roadmap, is there an initiative or two the customer would like to prioritize? Take note of the customer's reason behind this decision and indicate prioritized initiatives on the roadmap.  

#### Step 4: Begin to work with your customer on a new business opportunity.

You're now ready to align with the customer on the next MVP by starting over with <a href="/use-case-discovery" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>use case discovery</a>.
