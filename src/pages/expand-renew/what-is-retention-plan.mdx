## Mitigate Risk with a Retention Plan

The Retention Plan gives visibility into what is driving risk at the customer and provides a concrete action plan to mitigate that risk.<br/><br/>
Create a retention plan as soon as you identify a risk that is threatening revenue and/or customer adoption, such as:<br/>
* Customer has not downloaded entitlements they own<br/>
* Customer is experiencing financial disruption<br/>
* Customer expresses frustration or has logged a number of support tickets<br/>
* A competitive threat is uncovered (competitive POC, re-architecting, etc.)<br/>
* Product functionality is an issue<br/>
* There aren't any identified use cases

Include strategic and tactical actions being taken by both the customer and IBM to try to prevent the customer from churning.<br/>

### When do I need a Retention Plan?
The Success indicators in Gainsight will help you determine when a retention plan might be needed:
<br/> Red or yellow health score
<br/> Renewal in 9 months with no identified use case
<br/> Renewal in 6 months and use case is not yet at deploying/deployed

**Did you know?**

Use a <Link to='/expand-renew/project-risks' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>project risk CTA</Link> when a specific use case is in jeopardy.  Use a retention plan when the entire entitlement is at risk.

## Build the Retention Plan

Ensure you understand the customer situation and what is causing the risk.

Team with the Subscription and Annuity Rep to determine the next steps to ensure that the customer renews. Engage other IBM teams as needed to address the customer's challenges.

Best Practice: Give your plan a descriptive name so it is easily identified by others.
