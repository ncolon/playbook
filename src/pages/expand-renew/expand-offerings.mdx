## What is expansion?

When you have helped a customer achieve meaningful business outcomes with their initial use case, you have built a relationship with as their trusted CSM advisor. By understanding your customer's current and future projects and initiatives, you have the opportunity to grow the customer's use of their current entitlements and/or position additional products or services that align with their business objectives.

When you find an opportunity, you should open a CSM-Qualified Lead in ISC and assign it to a seller.

## Common expansion practices

Common practices include:

* Up-sell to generate more revenue from their current product
* Cross-sell to generate new revenue from a related product or services engagement
* Identify new use cases to increase deployments
* Find additional sponsors to find new use cases

### Collaborating with Partners

Ideally, you have been working with the relevant partners throughout the deployment phase, keeping them informed of progress or working hand-in-hand. These relationships are key when discussing expansion.

* Engage the partner to co-develop the appropriate expansion strategy. The partner brings insight into the strategic initiatives while you have experience with the current usage and use cases.
* There may also be more than one partner relationship at play - some IBM, some not. Consider any partner(s) from which your client purchased software as well as partners they may use as technology consultants or implementation service providers. You will need to navigate across these relationships to identify a path for growth.
* Be sure new opportunities are owned by the IBM partner of record for that portfolio area. This preserves trust in the channel relationship.

### Expansion opportunities with Cloud Pak products

Now that we are seeing traction with adoption of Cloud Paks, these do present expansion opportunities.  Below you will see several patterns where we were able to expand the deployment base using the cloud paks.

- **Cloud Pak for Data(CP4D)**
One of the standard patterns for CP4D is to start with Data Virtualization(Watson Query) closely followed by Datastage(transformations for the data ) followed by Data Governance(WKC) and then Machine learning to produce analytics utilizing Watson Studio/Watson Machine learning.  Lockheed Martin is a great example of this.  Capital Bank of Jordan below is much the same, but the data is coming from Netezza(data warehouse system). Bank of America is slightly different where they started with AI model management(WML/Watson Studio) and moved to Openscale/Spark analytics Engine. We are finding model management and governance is also a pattern that is quite successful.

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/#/view-use-case/c420ea7f-c767-46ab-9b32-4868464e3ad1">Lockheed Martin</a>: Watson Query was used in combination with Datastage, that led to Data Governance followed by MLOps - all continuing to grow for additional use cases.  This solution allowed Lockheed to democratize data, making it searchable across the enterprise.  Users were empowered through data discovery and self service

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/capital-bank">Capital Bank of Jordan</a>:  Netezza Data Warehouse was used to service data quickly and manage reporting, that then led to IBM Watson Machine learning (building out using IBM Watson Studio) and ultimately, Watson Openscale. The projects focused on suspicious transactions(Deployed), cross selling(Deploying), credit card spend stimulation(Deploying).

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/the-practice/2023-csm-americas-hightlight-stories/2023q1-bofa-americas-highlight">Bank of America</a>: Bank of America started with AI model management(CP4D/Watson Machine Learning and Watson Studio) deploying all models from a single platform(even models from competitors). Currently, the platform has over 200+ models in production and targeting 3,384 models by end of 2023. The second phase of the project for BofA was implementation of model scoring as a service where the goal was to reduce the time to score and deploy AI models, improve productivity and maintain performance, and improve AI Governance. This entailed Watson OpenScale and adding in Spark Analytic Engine where they were able to reduce the score time from hours to 20 minutes.

- **Cloud Pak for Business Automation(CP4BA)**
One of the standard patterns for CP4BA is deployment with content management, closely followed by and/or simultaneously deployed with  data capture and/or workflow(BAW).  

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC0y_2kEJhe0it4vuTl3240A">BPCE, France</a>: CP4BA serves as a service in the internal Cloud with support from CSM and Technology Expert Labs. The goal is business processes of loan management(Workflow and Decisions). The CP4BA deployment starts with content management(Filenet) from CP4BA and then followed with decision management(ODM) and workflow(BAW).

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2022-csm-spotlight/unicredit-bulbank">Unicredit Bank</a>: CP4BA provided a single view of all documents related to each specified customer, becoming a centralized repository of 1000+ document templates used by all business areas, and provided a product catalogue, consisting of a dynamic composition of hundreds of individual banking products and their bundling. The deployment consisted of Filenet and Business Automation Workflow capabilities as part of CP4BA.

- **Cloud Pak for Integration(CP4I)**
There are many patterns for CP4I where deployment with the integration services happen together, or you start with one deployment of capability and continue to expand that capability.  RakBank is ACE/MQ that is followed by more ACE/MQ given success in overall performance enhancements. In the case of Ajman Digital, the client started with ACE/MQ and started to expand to APIC followed by event streams. Bancolombia deployed their full infrastructure as part of the plan for CP4I(ACE, APIC, MQ, Datapower Gateway), where they are now progressing to Event Streams and ultimately Event automation.

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' hreaf="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2022-csm-spotlight/rakbank">RAKbank, United Arab Emirates</a>: The client relies heavily on their middleware capabilities to ensure seamless integration with Customers, Partners, the market and internal to their company. The client started with deployment of CP4I for ACE/MQ workloads and because of success, continues further expanding the integration modernization(ACE/MQ) agenda as they witness 200% performance enhancement by modernizing integration stack on OpenShift. As a result of the success, the expansion is planned in 4 Phases: phase 1&2 = 6%, phase 3 = 73%, and phase 4 = 21% of the overall integration workload.

  - <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2023-csm-spotlight/ajman-digital">Ajman Digital, United Arab Emirates</a>: From an initial middleware stack consisting of ACE and MQ, the client starts socializing digital government services using API Management layer(API Connect) and automate API events using a streaming platform(Event Streams) to unlock business insights and real-time visibility. 

  - **Bancolombia, Latin America**: Bancolombia moved to a new integration platform reducing the time needed to execute API migration, eanbling the bank to control application consumers using transactional services, and increased end-to-end service traceability. This was deployed on AWS on Openshift. They deployed CP4I(ACE, APIC, MQ Datapower Gateway) and WHE.
