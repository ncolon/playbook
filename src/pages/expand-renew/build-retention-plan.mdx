After your plan is implemented, provide details on what happened.

* Reflect on the outcome - did the plan work or not?  Why not?
* What actions led to positive results?  What actions did not work as expected?
* Did the customer provide feedback?  Capture it here so other CSMs can learn from the experience and make changes for the future.

Best Practice:  Document both success and failures.  Every plan is a good resource for future efforts.
