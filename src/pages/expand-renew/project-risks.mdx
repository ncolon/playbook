## Communicate a risk

As you work with your customer on the deployment of their offering, risks to the success of the plan can arise. You might simply work through some risks, but if a risk is significant enough to pose a threat to the plan, you should create a Project Risk Objective.  The Project Risk Objective is used to raise risks so that action can be taken to mitigate them - and there are no surprises if a project gets delayed or cancelled.  Managers will have visibility into Project Risk Objectives on their dashboards.  Remember that project Objectives are actually CTAs, so these will also be visible in your Cockpit.

You may also indicate a Risk rating on a non-Risk Objective, if an existing objective has some risk to it.  At the bottom of the Objective, select a Risk rating; it does not have to have Category of Risk.  Risk objectives and objectives with risk ratings are both considered project risks.

**Project Risk Objective**

If the plan has a risk but the overall relationship is still healthy, use a Project Risk Objective on the Objectives tab of the growth plan.

**Retention Plan**

If the entire relationship is at risk of churning, create a <Link to='/expand-renew/what-is-retention-plan' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Retention Plan</Link>  at the R360 level and explain the risk and mitigation plan.

## How do I create a Project Risk Objective in Gainsight?

1. Create a Project Risk from the Objectives tab in the Growth Plan.

2. On the Objectives tab, click  "Create" in the upper right, and "Add Manually"

3. Provide a short but descriptive name; this will appear in reports

4. Fill out the fields as completely as possible

5. Select Objective Category = Risk

6. Provide details about the Success Criteria - when will the risk be resolved?

7. Explain the risk in detail in the Comments field.

8. At the bottom, click "Add more details" to expand the Project Risk Section:<br/>
    a. Set the Risk Rating and select the appropriate Risk Reason (these tie very closely to the reasons in a Retention Plan)<br/>
    b. If you need help from your manager or someone else, check the Help Needed box. In the Comments field above, explain what help you need and from whom, if known.<br/>
    c. If you've selected Help Needed, select the high-level category of "Type of Help Needed".  See the available options below.<br/>
9. Save your work. The Risk will now appear as one of the objectives, with category of Risk.  Managers will see this risk in their dashboards, along with the Help Needed flag if selected.

### Type of Help Needed options

**Product Management:** assistance with product roadmap, strategy discussions, RFEs, and betas.<br/>
**Sales:** Get sales involved if something needs repositioned or resold or needs an upgrade for an additional service. Sales involvement might also be requested to discuss pricing changes/sales plays. Technical Sales Specialist is needed for demonstration or technical guidance.<br/>
**Development:** assistance with product changes needed by customer or addressing functionality gaps.<br/>
**Product SWAT:** product component expertise that cannot be addressed by support or TSS.<br/>
**Support:** assistance with outstanding support cases.<br/>
**Management:** Escalation is needed to get resources or other organizations to respond to requests for assistance. When in doubt, select this one.
