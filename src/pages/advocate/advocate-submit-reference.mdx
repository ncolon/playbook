## Why client advocacy matters

It is estimated that 85-97% of IT buyers indicate they rely on peer (client advocate) recommendations, ratings, and reviews. It is through the participation of IBM client references and advocates in various activities that will help influence future buyers.

## Clients as IBM advocates

Client references from numerous organizations have graciously agreed to participate in acts of advocacy for IBM - giving of their time, knowledge, and experience.  Clients have helped close deals, influenced the outcome of analyst reports, and elevated IBM’s brand through various activities.

Not all client references are created equally. That is why it is important to understand client reference activities can range in the ‘type’ of participation and frequency with which clients feel comfortable.

Clients can participate in either or both Private and Public reference activities, and they may choose how often and when they will participate (Note: even though a client may agree to participate at one point in time, the relationship can change, and clients are never obligated to participate):

## How to recognize a potential client reference

**Opportunity:** Your client’s IBM solution is deployed or in production and they recognize the value. The right time to have the conversation with the client about becoming a reference is when:<br/>
•	A project milestone has been achieved<br/>
•	An unexpected positive outcome<br/>
•	They state they are pleased or appreciative<br/>
•	They ask about buying more IBM solutions or expanding the contract <br/>

**Prepare:** Be sure you understand the available client reference activities before you have the conversation with your client. Think first about your client’s personality type and ensure you are ready to handle objections. It is essential to remind clients that they choose what they are willing to do, how often, and when. (Remember: “client reference” is often broadly associated with public acts of advocacy, which may discourage some clients. Take the time to explain the various opportunities).

**Inquire:** Every client will have different levels of comfort about participating in the reference program. Therefore, it is important to consider when and how you proceed with the client reference discussion. Some clients will happily only do peer-to-peer calls or anonymous analyst reports. Others will gladly speak at IBM events. You know your client's personality and the history of the IBM relationship.


## Overcome objections

**Objection 1:** We have a company policy against providing public references<br/>
**Answer:** Would you be willing to do a private reference? For example, would you:<br/>
  Participate in an analyst relations report (fully anonymous)?<br/>
  Agree to a peer-to-peer call?<br/>
  Write an anonymous product review?<br/>

**Objection 2:** I’m not at the right level in the organization<br/>
**Answer:** Anyone at any level in a client organization is free to write/publish product reviews. If you and your team use the product we welcome your honest and anonymous feedback.<br/>

**Objection 3:** I don’t want to go public with any statements about any vendors<br/>
**Answer:** I completely understand. We have a private reference program available too. It includes participation in analyst research, or taking a private call from one of your peers to tell them about your experience!<br/>

**Objection 4:** What’s in it for me?<br/>
**Answer:** Depending on your level of participation<br/>
  **Public:** notoriety, social eminence, networking opportunities, the market<br/>
  **Private:** work with analysts, meet your peers, influence the market<br/>

## Gaining agreement - how to submit a client reference

If your client is ready to participate as a reference, there a number of ways to get started.

*	Reach out to your client advocacy or marketing focal in your business unit and inform them of the willing client. You may be asked to provide more details or help coordinate a discussion between your client and the client advocacy focal.

* Enter your use case into STARS and indicate what the client is willing to participate in. The corporate client advocacy team reviews STARS for possible client stories.

*	Still unsure? Reach out to your business unit client advocacy or marketing leaders to get more information. (NOTE: Some Business Units offer BluePoints for newly recruited client references. Check with your client advocacy or marketing leader).
