| Acronym | Term | Definition |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ACEL | Aggregated Capped Enterprise License | A type of ELA catalog that allows deployment across a broad range of listed products (“catalog”) up to a financial cap value, using a predetermined consumption rate. The number of parts included in the catalog will be proportional to the size of the deal. |
| ACV | Annual Contract Value | This is the annual yearly revenue generated from each customer contract. | 
|   | Adoption (Product adoption) |  This term refers to customers' use of your product. It's short for "product adoption." Ensuring there is a quick adoption post a sale is a key part of the role of a CSM. A product that is being used adds value to a customer's business by solving a problem or creating a business opportunity. In return, customers that realize value, ensure a continued revenue stream for IBM. |
| CADET | Customer ADoption Engagement Tracker | Tool owned by the ELA Lifecycle Management organization to provide information and reporting on ELA software deployment across ELA contracts worldwide. |
| CTA | Call to Action | An automated approach designed to prompt an immediate response or encourage an immediate action. Within Customer Success, CTAs are used within Gainsight to bring your attention to dynamics that may need your action (e.g., upcoming renewal, abnormal change in usage, upsell or cross-sell opportunity). |
| CBA | Cross Brand Allotment | Additional dollars included in an ELA that the customer can use during the contract life for a variety of expenditures like software services. The Dealmaker or Software Client Leader have the details of intended use and control the process to access the funds. There are often limitations/directions for the use of the CBA may have been shaped in the contract phase, even if these are typically negotiable afterwards|
| CEL | Capped Enterprise License | A type of ELA catalog that allows deployment across a broad range of listed products (“catalog”) up to a quatity cap value. |
|  | Churn |  This is the opposite of renewal. If you have 100 customers for whom you are responsible and their total annual revenue is $1M. The following year, 92 of those customers continue to generate $980K in annual revenue. In this case, your customer retention is 92% and your revenue retention is 98%. In this example, your customer churn rate is 8% and your revenue churn rate is 2%.  | 
|   | Cross-sell |  This is often used synonymously, or in conjunction with, the term expansion. Technically, cross-sell is usually defined as the sale of additional products or services to an existing customer, but to a new buyer within that customer. For example, if you have a large customer with multiple divisions, when a 2nd or 3rd division becomes part of your install base, either with a second instance or licenses being extended to them, this would typically be considered cross-sell.  It can also mean selling additional products/services to the same buyer. For example, a customer using Cloud Pak for Data, may purchase entitlement to Cloud Pak for Automation to integrate their data within their business process. |
| CTL | Committed Term License | Like monthly licenses, committed term licenses enable clients to purchase licenses to software in a cloud-centric model, where ownership expires without renewal of the license. |
| CS | Customer Success | Increasing common in software companies and other stream revenue businesses, Customer Success is the business methodology of ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes while using our products and services. Customer Success is relationship-focused client management, it aligns client and vendor goals for mutually beneficial outcomes.  While some organizations focus primarily on the business relationship, IBM emphasizes the technical nature of the relationship to drive product deployment and adoption with our customers. |
| CSM | Customer Success Manager (Brand Architect) | The person who is responsible for ensuring our customers achieve their desired outcomes whilst using our products and services. They drive business value and technology outcomes throughout the customer lifecycle with C&CS Growth Offerings to support IBM's Hybrid Cloud and AI Platform strategy. |
| CVA | Client Value Acceleration | This refers to both a customer-focused document as well as an interactive session with the customer.   The objective of this session is to continue the transition from pre-sales to post-sales by clearly communicating the content of the customer's ELA contract and the value that can be delivered. | 
|   | Deployment or usage milestone | Deployment Milestones, sometimes referred to as Usage Milestones, are the key moments your customers go through as they are adopting our products - from when they first get access and identify a use case, to when they see business value. |
| DMSS | Dealmaker's Spreadsheet | A record of how the IBM Dealmaker built the ELA and what is contained in it. Implemented as an Excel workbook template that the dealmaker uses to determine the charges associated with the new software and services in the contract. Any software contract or amendment that contains enterprise license agreements for significant new software purchases will include a DMSS. The main purpose of the DMSS is to define the cash flow for the software and services charges that will make up the deal and to determine to which business units the revenue will flow. |
| DPO | Deployment Project Office | Diamond was developed to help our largest customers derive business value from their large IBM software contracts.  It was built around the notion of customer success being the ultimate goal.  The DPO is responsible for the collection of customer deployment reports, loading those into the Cadet tracking tool, and preparing the reports for internal commission processing. |
| DSW | Distributed Software Warehouse (Entitlement System) | Use this tool to create a Customer Site Summary Report that shows transaction history for a specific product, product history and evolution, additional part number data, and renewable entitlements. (Note that you can create “Customer Lists” on the DSW Entitlement System. Lists for which you’ve requested a report can be automatically downloaded to IBM LILO and will appear once LILO data is refreshed with the server.) |
| ELA | Enterprise License Agreement | A single contract consolidating IBM software purchases. ELA is a multi-platform software offering - all platforms and all IBM brands are applicable. A Customer commits to a single bottom-line price for total software acquisition. An ELA can offer a monthly license charge growth allowance (cap), one-time-charge software, services and other terms and conditions. It can cover a period from one to five years. The key thing for a Customer Success Manager when engaging with a customer who has an ELA is we try to make sure they are getting so much value they need to invest more and "use up" the money that was associated with that contract. |
| ESMT | Enterprise Software Management Tool | ESMT provides clients with visibility to their ELA inventory and drawdowns and enables automated deployment reporting to IBM. The free web portal hosted by IBM provides an alternative to time-consuming spreadsheets to track and report ELA software usage for all types of ELAs and substitution contracts.  The interface is simple and proven, with customizable features. There are over one hundred satisfied ESMT customers world-wide. See also ILMT, IASP. |
| FREV | Financial Revenue | Booked revenue – what IBM recognizes in the ledger that and is post discount. INTERNAL ONLY – NOT TO BE SHARED WITH CUSTOMER. |
| GCLM | Global Contract Lifecycle Manager | The repository for all IBM ELA contracts worldwide. One of the data sources that feeds CADET. |
| IASP | IBM Authorized Software Asset Management Provider | A business partner authorized to perform audit-ready ELA deployment reporting, contracted by a customer to fulfill audit requirements.  See also ESMT.  Sample IASP vendors include Anglepoint, etc.) |
| ILMT | IBM License Metric Tool | Maintains an up-to-date inventory of software assets that are installed in your infrastructure, gathers information about your hardware, and ensures license compliance of your enterprise. Always know what software you have, where it is, and how it is used. By monitoring PVU and RVU MAPC consumption of IBM® products under full and sub-capacity licensing terms, you can understand current license consumption and predict future ones. |
| IPL | Incentive Plan Letter | Notice from IBM, specifically with details supplied by the first line manager, which documents the conditions of variable pay (commissions) for those on a sales pay plan. |
|   | Journey map |  This is a visual representation of the process a customer goes through with IBM. In our CS organization it is the process the customer goes through from when they purchase through their expansion and renewals. With the help of a customer journey map, you can get a sense of your customers' motivations, their needs, pain points and understand potential next steps to consider based on where your client is. | 
| NPS | Net Promoter Score | This is a survey methodology that is used by many companies, including IBM, to evaluate customer satisfaction.  These surveys are one measure of customer health and may even be incorporated into the measurement of a CSM. The true value of NPS beyond the score is the feedback that, when acted upon, improves the overall customer experience and generates customer advocacy. |
| NRR | Net Revenue Retention | Net revenue retention tells a company how healthy its existing customer base is.  It measures the total change in recurring revenue from a pool of customers over time and is calculated as follows: The company's monthly recurring revenue (MRR) one year ago divided by the current MRR from that same group of customers. Net Revenue Retention equals b/a. Implicitly, net revenue retention captures the negative impact of lost customers, but also the positive impact of price changes, cross-sells, up-sells, and growth in usage within the installed base of customers. |
| PA | Passport Advantage | Passport Advantage and Passport Advantage Express are comprehensive IBM programs that use a common set of Agreements, processes, and tools. Passport Advantage (PA) is focused on larger enterprises whereas Passport Advantage Express, a transaction-based program, addresses the needs of medium-sized businesses.  Includes the pricing model, terms and conditions for purchase of most IBM distributed system software and OTC and fixed term z Systems software.  Passport Advantage is governed by the International Program License Agreement (IPLA). |
|  | Paygo | A month-to-month relationship between IBM and a client.  This contractual relationship is most prevalent in our IBM Cloud business. The client can opt-out at any time so there is no renewal event (signed or auto). You can think of these as if the customer is renewing (or possibly churning) every month. |
| PVU | Processor Value Unit | A metric developed to normalize the compute capacity of various processor types so that IBM can sell and deliver software capacity in standard units less affected by the performance of the underlying hardware.  A processor core type (e.g. Power 9, mainframe IFL, Intel Xeon) is assigned a number of PVUs that represent the quantity of licensed software capacity necessary to deploy on that particular processor core. For example, an Intel Xeon-based server is designated as requiring 50 PVUs/core.  To deploy a product on a 16-core Intel Xeon based server, a client would need to purchase 16 * 50, or 800 PVUs of software licenses for that product. See also Resource Value Unit (RVU).  Is a type of Proof of Entitlement (PoE). |
|   | Ratings or invoices | Ratings or Invoicing are used as a mechanism to talk about usage on IBM Cloud.  From a legacy perspective, Ratings refers to the PaaS usage and Invoices refers to the IaaS usage.  In both cases the value represents the usage times list price as a way to normalize the value of the usage across all services for the customer.
|  | Renewal Rate | The Renewal Rate is the rate at which you keep your customers and their associated revenue. In this simplified example, you have 100 customers for whom you are responsible and their total annual revenue is $1M. The following year, 92 of those customers continue to generate $980K in annual revenue. In this case, your customer retention is 92% and your revenue retention is 98%.  In IBM, this metric is most frequently discussed based on Annual Contract Values. |
| RVU | Resource Value Unit | Similar to PVU, Resource Value Units are a type of Proof of Entitlement. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of RVUs required for Licensee's environment as defined by the specific software terms. RVU entitlements are specific to the Program and the type of resource and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with RVU entitlements of another program or resource. |
| SPI | Sensitive Personal Information | IBM considers some types of PI as being "sensitive" due to the risks that such information could be misused to significantly harm an individual in a financial, employment or social way. IBM should not collect or retain such information unless it is necessary to achieve a legitimate business purpose. |
|   | Success Plan | This is a clear statement of "what" and "how" you will deliver value throughout the customer lifecycle. The Success Plan is customized for a specific customer in the context of their entitlement built by understanding expectations, both your customer's and IBMs. There are 3 success plan formats: <br/>Growth Plan - primary plan used when working with a client.<br/> Retention Plan - used when there is a risk that the client will not renew to document the risk and activate the broader cross-functional team to assist in overcoming the risk.<br/> Defection Plan - used when the client loss is no longer avoidable.  This is used as a reporting mechanism where CSMs communicate why the client was lost. | 
| UEL | Unlimited Enterprise License | A type of ELA contract that allows the customer to deploy an unlimited quantity of the products included. |
| | Upsell or expansion | This term is used to describe the sale of more of an existing offering to an existing customer.  Within IBM, we define this as more within the same Level 30 in the IBM Taxonomy.  | 
| VPC | Virtual Processor Core | A virtual processor core (VPC) is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the licensing cost of IBM services. It is based on the number of virtual cores (vCPUs) dedicated to a service's instance or runtime. |
