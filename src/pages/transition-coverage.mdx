## You've been reassigned - what to do with your old entitlements?

A change in CSM can be stressful for everyone involved: new CSM, previous CSM, and the customer.  When it occurs, follow these steps to ensure we maintain the best customer experience possible.

Work with your manager to determine if a new CSM will be immediately assigned or if the responsibility for deployment will be passed back to the brand technical seller.

Meet with the new CSM and the customer to formally handover the account, but before you go, complete certain updates in Gainsight to pave the way for a smooth transition.

**Timeline**<br/>
Create final timeline entries with a subject of "Transitioning off Customer" that contain the key status on the customer and deployments.  Keep it net, but consider what are the things that you would want to know if you were assigned to this customer for the first time.  Make final timeline entries on the Relationship record for any entitlement on which you were engaged with the customer.<br/>
**Success Plans**<br/>
Review all open Success Plans and update them with the latest status and details of any discussions you've had with the customer on how each plan was to be executed.  Ensure these items are clear and up to date:

* Who are the key players at the customer or within IBM?
* Is the use case well documented?
* What is the current status - is your timeline up to date?<br/>
**Guidance by status:**<br/>
- Plans in "Identified" status:** ensure your initial ideas are well documented - or closed out with "No plans to deploy" if you know they will not be pursued.
- Deployed - if there is no further work to do, close the plan<br/>
**Sentiment Health**<br/>
* Refresh the Sentiment health score with the latest sentiment
* Provide an updated Sentiment health comment explaining why you set the Sentiment in this way<br/>
**CTAs**<br/>
Review all open CTAs and close out those that have been completed or are no longer relevant.

1. **Set up a meeting** with the new CSM to discuss your customer and their current situation.  Review the customer overall as well as the relationships you've been working on.  Jointly create a transition plan with the customer in mind. Suggested topics:<br/>
* What is the customer's current environment?
* Current IBM relationship with the customer ?
* Who are your key contacts and their roles?
* Review your timeline notes.
* Review recent meetings and discuss upcoming meetings and how the new CSM should participate.
* Review your success plans and ensure the CSM understands the use case and knows the sponsor and progress.
* Review open CTAs and explain as needed.
* Review the Sentiment and why you set it that way.
* Transition planning
2. **Change the CSM assignment** on the R360 summary tab.  For more information, refer to the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/gainsight-user-community/managers-corner/assigning-csms-to-customers#AssigningCSM' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> Assigning CSMs to Customers page.</a><br/>
3. **For each relationship:**<br/>
* **Transition Success Plans.**  Take the new CSM through the current status and next steps.<br/>
* **Change the owner of the plan to the new CSM.**  To do this:
1. Click on your initials at the top left of the success plan
2. In the resulting pop-out search bar, find the name of the new CSM and select it
3. If you have any Objectives, reassign them to the new CSM by opening each Objective and clicking on your initials in the upper corner.<br/>
**Note:** you do not need to change the "CSM Assignment Date" - that is a system-generated date that will automatically update.<br/>
4. **Assign remaining open CTAs** to the new CSM by changing the Owner name<br/>
5. **Set up a call with your customer** to introduce the new CSM and complete the transition.<br/>
Once these steps are complete - congratulations!  You have successfully transitioned.
