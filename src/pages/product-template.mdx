## What is 'product' and what does it do? <br/>
*provide a description of the product and what it does for a customer*

## What are the pain points that 'product' addresses?

*Summary of what the product can solve for a customer* <br/><br/>

**Pain Point: **Describe the pain point this product can solve for a customer <br/>
'product' can help by...<br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **


## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Instana follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
Include links<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, TAM and CSM can work together to connect product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs can take ownership of an implementation project using their <a href='https://soda.dal1a.ciocloud.nonprod.intranet.ibm.com/show/3618' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>pre-packaged offerings.</a> Product TAM and CSM can help guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What are the personas you might run into when talking to a customer about product?

*Edit this list to fit your product*

**Engineering Leadership Buyer**: CIOs, CTOs, or VPs - responsible for aligning a company’s overall IT strategy and systems to support the company’s goals. <br/>
*Primary interest*: Release new application features rapidly and on-time.<br/>
*Observability needs*: Business metrics to track customer satisfaction.<br/>
*Instana positioning*: Provides immediate business KPIs.<br/>

**DevOps Engineer**: Deliver reliable products that run well in production. Speed software delivery at a higher level of quality and with lower costs.<br/>
*Primary interest*: Processes, methodologies, and tools for software development life cycle enhancement.<br/>
*Observability needs*: CI/CD pipeline optimization.<br/>
*Instana differentiation*: Observe cloud, hybrid, on premises applications in pre-production and production.<br/>

**Developer**: Develops fresh code for new products, porting legacy apps to cloud native, code fixes for maintenance, and code for business logic.<br/>
*Primary interest*: ensuring applications they develop can be deployed and run in production with no issues<br/>
*Observability needs*: Detailed and precise application code issue alerts.<br/>
*Instana differentiation*: Automatic profiling and end-to-end traces with context to enable instant triage.<br/>

**SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)**: Protect and progress the software and systems behind all services focusing on availability, performance, and capacity.<br/>
*Primary interest*: Achieve SLOs for application uptime, performance, and mean time to detect (MTTD) and remediate (MTTR)<br/>
*Observability needs*: 1) Early issue discovery 2) Reducing MTTR.<br/>
*Instana differentiation*: Service level objective (SLO) monitoring with automated discovery and context to reveal root cause. Rapid MTTR.<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

*Describe for your product*

## Why would a customer deploy Instana if they already have a 'blank' solution in house?

*Provide examples and include questions the CSM might ask the customer*



## How do I expand and grow 'product' usage?

*Describe some typical land and expand use cases*




## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
