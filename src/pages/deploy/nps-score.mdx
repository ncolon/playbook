In 2024, IBM moved to Qualtrics as the survey platform for NPS. Customer Success surveys are expected to resume in Q3.

Candidates to receive NPS surveys are selected every two weeks based on Growth Plan content in Gainsight. At this time, only Cloud Paks and Cartridges deploying or deployed on OpenShift are eligible to be surveyed. Survey results are available on the R360 and other dashboards.

Typically, the survey results are available in Gainsight the day after Medallia receives them.  There is a window of 2-3 days per month when they are delayed, based on the UTL refresh schedule.

## When will my customer be surveyed?

The Project Sponsor is a candidate to receive an NPS survey invitation when their Cloud Pak or Cartridge OpenShift Deployment Project has moved into either the Deploying or Deployed Project Stage in the last two weeks. The NPS team will determine who receives the survey based on opt-out data and when the customer was last surveyed. One survey might be sent when the project reaches Deploying and another survey might be sent when the project reaches Deployed.

Make sure your growth plan is up to date. Content in the following fields triggers a candidate for an NPS survey:
- **Project Sponsor** In the Relationship Person record, First Name, Last Name, and Email address are required to send a survey.  The survey is sent to this email address.
- **Project Stage** is Deploying or Deployed
- **Deployment Platform** is OpenShift

**Opt out**

Your customer can opt out of Medallia/NPS surveys by selecting the Opt-Out option on their first NPS survey.
<br/>
The Gainsight Opt Out selections on the People record only apply to Gainsight communications. They do not apply to Medallia.

## Where can I find survey results?

You can find the results on the Mgt: FLM dashboard.

If you want to find growth plans related to survey results received in the last 30 days, review the Cloud Pak NPS Survey Responses - Last 30 days.

### Cloud Pak and Cartridge R360s NPS surveys

Only the Cloud Pak and Cartridge entitlements with OpenShift Deployment Projects with surveys submitted will show data in the NPS R360 section.

### Survey results

To get a pie chart of your survey results, in the NPS R360 section, select "Pie Chart: Survey Results" from the dropdown.

This reports the breakdown of NPS "Likely to Recommend" scores received for projects on this relationship within the past year. Each NPS "Likely to Recommend" pie slice offers a drill down to see additional details on that NPS score survey result.

### Survey result details

To view details on the surveys received in the last year, in the NPS R360 section, select "Details: Survey Results" from the dropdown.

| NPS detail | Description |
| ------ | ---------|
| Deployment Plan Name | Links to the Deployment Project for which the survey was submitted |
| Survey Id | The internal Medallia survey id |
| Response Date | Date the survey was submitted sorted by newest to oldest |
| Likely to Recommend (LTR) | This is the main NPS score; is the customer likely to recommend IBM to others?<br/> Score of 9-10 = Promoters; 7-8 = Passive; and 0-6 = Detractors |
| LTR Reason for Score | Any comments given by the customer to explain why they scored LTR between 0 and 10. <br/> For lower scores when comments are provided, this helps you understand where the Customer would like to see improvement |
| The additional columns show more specific, optional questions | For a low LTR when completed, this helps you hone in on where they were happy or not |
| Lastly, there are two additional open ended questions for "How could IBM have better delivered" and "How could IBM have been support or enabled the customer" |  These can provide additional insight |
