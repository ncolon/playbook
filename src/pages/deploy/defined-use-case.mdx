## My customer has a well-defined use case

**Your customer has a well-defined use case and a defined process that requires a product that is new to them.**

If you have met with your customerâ€™s sponsor and determined that they have a well-defined use case and process they want to follow, they may simply want your help installing their offering. In this case, be sure you understand the use case for the offering. You will also need to understand their technical environment through a simple conversation with your technical contact.  After you know the environment, help to install and configure their offering. Demo the features they might use in their solution. Regularly keep in touch to provide assistance with Support, renewal, and expansion.
