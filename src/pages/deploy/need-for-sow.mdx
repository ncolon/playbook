## Types of customer engagements

There are times when you might not be sure if the customer engagement might require an SOW versus use of the CSM Engagement Letter.

### Use the CSM Engagement Letter to cover IBM and your customer

The CSM Engagement Letter is an IBM Counsel-approved letter that covers you when you might need to access customer data and work in the customer's environment. You can deliver the CSM Engagement Letter to your customer minimize overhead and enable you to continue to make progress with your customer.

**Note:** Some customers require a CSM to be part of a services contract before they can access their systems.
If this is the case, the customer usually will provide a standard agreement that is signed by the customer and IBM. IBM does not create a contractual aggreement (SOW).

## When do I give the customer the Engagement Letter vs an SOW?


| When do I need a SOW? | CSM action | Engagement Letter | SOW |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Your customer is looking for help configuring or building out a use case in their production environment. | As a CSM, you should not do this. Instead think about their gaps and bring in either Technology Expert Labs or a partner to put a paid proposal in front of the customer. | No | Yes |
| You are working in a customer's environment that also hosts their production environment. | Signing into a production environment requires additional protection for IBM and the customer. | No | Yes |
| You are being asked to sign into a customer's production environment. | Signing into a production environment requires additional protection for IBM and the customer. | No | Yes |
| You are helping to install in a test environment in the customer's environment. The environment requires changes to a component that is part of the customer's production environment (network, server, database, etc) | It depends. If you are going to make any changes to the environment, you will need an SOW.  However, if you are coaching the customer regarding the configuration changes needed, then you can simply provide the Engagement Letter. | It depends | It depends|
| You are working with a customer in a test environment that is in an isolated environment and does not require any changes to the customers production environment (network, server, database, etc) and no access to a system that might store their client's data | You should not need an SOW. You can simply provide the client the Engagement Letter. | Yes | No |
| The customer has their first use case deployed and now you are positioning a new use case for the same offering. The customer wants to see it in their current environment. | Recommend a development environment to your customer so that they can try things out without introducing risk. If there is a need for you to run it in a production environment, an SOW is required. | It depends |  It depends |
