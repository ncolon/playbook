In this stage, you have a sponsor who has agreed to proceed with deploying the prioritized use case. When in this stage the sponsor may not yet be ready to move forward, but is committed. Projects can skip from Propose to Planning if work continues after the sponsor is identified.

If you do not already have a sponsor, you can use the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCQjf8FMD4jpb89XB624MmTQ9h48'>Relationship Barometer tool</a> in ISC to evaluate your business relationships and determine the political power each individual might hold.

## Gain agreement from the sponsor

After you have refined the use case, it is time to get sponsor commitment on both the solution and the measure of success.

If the sponsor has been involved all along, their commitment might be implied. As a best practice, however, the key individuals you have been working with at the customer should jointly review with the sponsor to ensure agreement on:

* The workload - what business problem is being solved.
* Success criteria - what are the key predictive indicators (KPIs) that will give insight into workload build?
* Resources - any infrastructure and human resources are lined up and committed to build the workload.
* Timeline - expectations on timeline for key workload.


## Expand the engaged stakeholders

To move a workload into production, you will require an additional set of stakeholders. For example, you might need to engage: additional tool owners, security or networking stakeholders, the operations team, etc.

## What if the sponsor is not in agreement?

If the sponsor does not agree that the workload, success criteria, resources, or timeline are defined correctly, then you will need to go back to discover the prioritized use case.
