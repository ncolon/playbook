IBM Cloud Technology Expert Labs has three existing technical health assessments defined and ready to deliver to your customer for a fee.

Technical health assessments typically involve an opening presentation, a series of interviews with customer personnel and other data gathering techniques, and a concluding report and presentation to the customer on findings and recommendations for further action.

Technology Expert Labs can also provide architectural design, as well as build & migrate services to help execute on those recommendations. The picture below provides a view of the categories where IBM Cloud Expert Labs can provide assessments, architectural and advisory, and build and migrate services.
