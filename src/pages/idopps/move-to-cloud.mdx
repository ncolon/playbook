## My customer is ready to move to the cloud

**Your customer has a use case that requires them to move to the IBM Cloud.**

If you have met with your customerâ€™s sponsor and determined that they have a well-defined use case that requires them to move to IBM Cloud to modernize an existing application or create a new one, help them to get started using the IBM Cloud. After you understand their use case and environment, install and configure their cloud. If they are using offering features that they are unfamiliar with, demo the features they can use in their solution. Regularly keep in the touch to provide assistance with Support, renewal, and expansion.

## Overcome objections to Red Hat OpenShift adoption

There are several scenarios where the customer has determined that they need to move to the cloud, but are not convinced that Red Hat OpenShift is the right solution for them. There are videos and decks created by the RedHat team to help you overcome the customer's objections.
These scenarios are where the customer:

- Has decided to use xKS and doesn't understand the additional benefits OpenShift provides.
- Is currently using or considering VMWare Tanzu and does not understand the value of Openshift.
