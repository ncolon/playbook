## Start the modernization discussion

Where you start the modernization discussion depends on a few different things. Note that there will be some product upgrades that do not involve modernization.

*Where is the customer in their modernization journey?<br/>
*Have they just started or are they already on their way?<br/>
*What are they interesting in modernizing?  Infrastructure, Platform, Applications, Data, Integration?
<br/>
The type of modernization session you provide depends on the answers to these questions. You might need to start with modernization basics and proceed to a deeper dive into specific modernization use cases based on your customer’s environment and modernization goals.

### What does modernization mean?

**"Kyle Brown, IBM Fellow and CTO: Cloud Architecture and Cloud Modernization"**
An application...consists of one (but usually more) custom-written program components together with the supporting infrastructure, application middleware, middleware services (such as databases, queuing software, integration software and other aspects), and other components that make up a complete solution. It probably is deployed over several computers, either for scalability horizontally (the same component deployed multiple times) or vertically (the solution is split into multiple coordinating components). It may split itself across multiple geographical regions, or across multiple operating systems or computing architectures.

Many existing  customers acquire their growth offering entitlements by trading up their existing foundational offerings. For example, they might trade DB2 for IBM Cloud Pak for Data or MQ and ACE/IIB for Cloud Pak for Integration. Because of this, the modernization of existing workloads to run on Red Hat OpenShift is an extremely important approach to drive consumption.


### Who attends?

Strive for an impactful modernization session by not overwhelming the customer with IBMers.

Avoid "observers" who do not have a key role in the session.

## Understanding modernization basics

How you begin a modernization session depends on the starting point of the customer. If they have not started using containers and Kubernetes to containerize their enterprise applications or building new cloud native applications, start with digital courses to introduce the basic concepts to familiarize them with basic concepts and building blocks.


1. Start with the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/content/field-guide/app-modernization-field-guide" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Application Modernization Field Guide</a> to get a basic understanding of application modernization.

2. Read more in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/application-modernization" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Application Modernization reference architecture</a>.

3. Read the blog - <a href="https://medium.com/ibm-garage/the-steps-to-application-modernization-for-the-cloud-part-1-7ac07515dc16" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>The steps to application modernization for the cloud — Part 1</a>.

5. Read the deck <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/84991289939?s=dnuitcmdmdym8x531khvej1pe2tvahy3" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Track the voyage to modernization</a>

## Develop a modernization strategy and roadmap

 Customers who have a well-defined modernization use case are focused on modernizing their current environment and need to clearly understand how to move their workloads from the current traditional approach to a new cloud native approach.

Conduct a discussion on modernization patterns to establish how the customer can take advantage of new technology.

Working with your customer, select one modernization use case to start to co-create a solution.


## Engage IBM Technology Expert Labs to conduct a free modernization workshop

When your customer needs a deep, technical, hands-on review of their existing systems to generate a vision of the to-be architecture, you can bring Technology Expert Labs into the engagement.


IBM Technology Expert Labs offers free workshops that enable the team to understand the customer’s current state, identify use cases, and generate a to-be architecture that helps your customer realize their business opportunities.  The workshops include hands-on experience with IBM products, including WebSphere Hybrid Edition, IBM Cloud Pak for Integration, IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, and IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.


See slide 3 in the deck to learn how to engage the Technology Expert Labs.
