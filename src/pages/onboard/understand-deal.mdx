## Understand what was sold

It is critical that you and the Account team appear as one "Team IBM". You need to understand what was sold and by whom. Considerations might include whether the entitlement was sold as part of an ELA or whether there is a business partner involved.

You are expected to participate in the <Link to="/onboard/strategic-account-planning" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Strategic Account Planning process</Link> where you have an opportunity to contribute your knowledge regarding the status of the customer's deployment. Use this planning process to ensure you learn about the IBM team, what was sold, and about the customer.

You should dig into this information before meeting with your account team and especially prior to meeting with your customer Business Sponsor.

## Find your customer in ISC

You can find information about the IBM account team in ISC. Before heading to ISC, you will need to go to Gainsight to get the DBGID.

1. Go to Gainsight
2. Go to Entitlements
3. See the contract start date and take note of it. Copy the DBGID.
4. In <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibmsc.lightning.force.com/lightning/page/home">IBM Sales Cloud (ISC)</a>, search on the DBGID
5. Go to Account, then Opportunities
6. In Seller Search, find the IBM Account team, Tech Sales, Sales Specialist. To narrow your search, pick the org name that matches your segment.
7. After you are in the Opportunity, determine who sold the deal. Learn if it was sold by IBM, a partner, or digitally. If there is a transition document, there should be a use case field that contains what was sold, why it was sold, the use case, and any key technical artifacts.
<br/>
Prepare to introduce yourself and describe your role to the account team.

## If your customer worked with Technology Expert Labs, learn about the project

Technology Expert Labs (TEL) uses <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/expertlabs-playbook/playbook/clarizen/clarizen-guide/'>Clarizen</a> to manage their services projects.  The first steps to share data between TEL and Customer Success have been taken and TEL Project data is now visible in Gainsight.  Soon, TEL team members will have access to a Gainsight dashboard that enables them to see deployment progress driven by their CSM counterparts.

Use this TEL Project information to understand how TEL is engaged with your customers and to collaborate with your TEL colleagues. 
In Gainsight, you can view TEL Project data on the C360 TEL tab.  This report displays the customer projects, the project manager, the delivery manager, project status, start and end dates, and overall project health.  You can view details about the health of the project on the <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/expertlabs-playbook/playbook/el-manage-project/maintain-project-health/'>Project Health Settings</a> page. Use the Customers with Active TEL Projects widget on the CSM dashboards to display similar data. 

Note: Only a small percentage of TEL Projects include the UT30 codes, which enable Gainsight to match them to Relationships.  Where possible, the Relationship is included in the TEL Project reports.  Since this number is so small, TEL Projects are not displayed at the Relationship level; to do so would be misleading since so many projects would not be listed.


## If your customer has an IBM Partner, understand how to work with them

It is common to discover that your customer purchased the IBM solution from an <Link to="/onboard/business-partner" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Partner</Link>.  Partners also provide services to customers for onboarding, deploying and supporting IBM solutions.

## Was there a Proof of Experience (PoX)?

Did your customer work with Client Engineering (CE) and did they implement a technology pattern? The technical patterns represent IBM's point-of-view and they rapidly prove the value of the pattern in the clients' contexts.

If CE implemented one of the prescriptive <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/skol/hypersonic-landing-page-squidfunk/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Technology Sales Technical Patterns</a>, you have a great starting point to understand the use case, opportunity, and customer's goals.

## Does your customer have an ELA? and are they in the Diamond program?

When you meet to discuss this ELA with the IBM account team, here are some questions you might ask:

* Does my customer have an ELA? <Link to="/onboard/ELA" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>How do I handle an ELA</Link>
* <Link to="/onboard/ELA#Is my customer in the Diamond program?" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Is your customer in the Diamond program?</Link>
* What did we sell?
* Do they have a use case? Can I advance the use case?
* How do I open the conversation when the customer has an ELA?
* How does this offering fit into the customer's strategic objectives?
* <Link to="/deploy/ela-pipeline" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>What is the Diamond pipeline and how do I build it?</Link>

If there is no use case, you might consider engaging client engineering to hold an Opportunity session to identify the use case.

## Understand the customer's business use case

When you meet with the customer, you need to understand their business use case. Support them in creating their business use case by providing clarity on successful outcomes using IBM technology.

* If your customer does not have a clearly defined business use case, work through a <Link to="/use-case-discovery" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Use Cases Discovery session</Link> with them to discover a prioritized use case.

* Leverage the <Link to="/onboard/business-outcomes-framework" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Business Outcomes framework</Link> to understand potential successful business outcomes
* Review customer references in your industry using the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cpo" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM IT Economics Consulting & Research</a>
