## Manage your portfolio using the CSM dashboard

The CSM dashboard for CS Brand Architects provides reports to help you focus on your customers and their deployment journeys.  The dashboard is filtered for your name as either the R360 CSM or as the Data and AI CSM on IBM Cloud. This will help you manage Data and AI entitlements on IBM cloud.
