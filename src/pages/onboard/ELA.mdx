## What is an ELA?

An Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) is a financial transaction that enables a customer to acquire the software and software maintenance (subscription and support) that they might expect to use during the ELA term – along with an allocation for software-related services and, in some cases, the option to acquire additional software at a pre-determined price. Most ELAs are for a term of one to five years and are valued in the multi-million-dollar range.

As you become familiar with your customer’s ELA, it will be helpful to understand how much of the ELA software had a defined use case at the time of ELA signing.  This will help you to develop a strategy and action plan to advance the deployment of the software. Be sure to interlock with the rest of the account team to understand the customer’s deployment history. The dealmaker often has tremendous insight into the deal construct and history.

## Is this entitlement an ELA?

Cloud Pak entitlements that are part of an ELA are easily identified in Gainsight. When you look under Available Entitlement IDs, you will see whether it is an ELA.

Unfortunately, for non-Cloud Paks, there is no easy way. However, in Gainsight, if the ACV is $0, and the Entitlement Qty has a value of 1, you can be pretty sure it is an ELA. Your job is to get the customer to use as much of that offering as possible.

## How do I get started?

It is often the case with a large ELA that there are few use cases for individual products. The customer is entitled to use the software because it is in their ELA catalog, but they might have little awareness that the product is available or what it does. Making them aware that it’s there, that it has value, and getting them to take the first small step of a use case discovery session is hard!  If there is already a Client Engineering team assigned, they can help define a use case. Otherwise, it is up to you to uncover the opportunity and use case that your products can help solve.

## Discuss with the IBM Account team

Start by contacting your ELA deployment leader where one exists (Diamond market program manager or unit deployment leader). Inquire about any workshops that may have been conducted with the customer and any current activities related to the ELA.

When you meet to discuss this ELA with the IBM account team, here are some questions you might ask:

* What did we sell?
* Was there a customer sponsor that wanted this product in the ELA?
* Is there a use case? How can I advance the use case?
* How can I best start engaging with the customer – key customer sponsors, current deployment projects, deployment gaps and risks I can start addressing?
* How does this offering fit into the customer's strategic objectives?
* Does the customer rely on other technology consultants or partners to guide their priority decisions?

If there is no use case:
*	Consider engaging Client Engineering to hold a Use Case Discovery session to identify the use case.
*	If the customer works with a Global Systems Integrator (GSI), the IBM team working with that GSI might have unique insight that could lead to possible deployment opportunities. Identify the GSI and then seek out the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ecosystem-engineering-si-lab/contacts' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>appropriate individual contacts</a>.

## Is my customer in the Diamond program?

The Diamond program is a comprehensive post-sales program designed to focus on ELA software deployment to maximize customer value and minimize risk to IBM of lack of deployment.

**Not all ELA customers are included in the Diamond program.** ELAs are selected to be part of the Diamond program based on factors that include having contract sections that require regular reporting of deployment to IBM, the amount of time left in the contract, and the amount of undeployed software remaining in the contract.

### CS Account Specialist

CS Account Specialists are assigned to customers in our Diamond program. They cover all software in reporting sections of their Diamond ELAs. CS Account Specialists work closely with customers, partners, and the account team to secure projects and sponsors, build deployment plans, guide customers into production, and ensure clients have the best experience with IBM technology. Customers also have Customer Success Brand Architects who are experts in a particular technology. CS Brand Architects and Account Specialists work together to maximize adoption and usage.

## Understand how the ELA was sold

For a Diamond customer, if you are a CS Account Specialist, you might have already participated in the Large Deal Workshop to gain insight and contribute to the customer account planning process.

Information can come from anyone who was on the account team at ELA signing. You can try to talk with the market ELA program leaders or the customer. Technology Sellers who were previously Client Reps or Software Client Leaders and the Technology or previous Software Deployment Leaders are excellent resources. Look in CADET to learn about ELA content and what has already been deployed.


### Prepare for the conversation with your customer

1. Review all CADET data for the contracts using the External Customer View.  Do not use the Diamond DMS Dashboard.
2. How much and what is deployed?
3. What is the current deployment pipeline?
4. Learn what projects the customer has in place to draw down the ELA (and against which contract if there are multiple).
5. Is there a current deployment plan or action plan in place? Confirm plans with the CS Brand Architect.


### Open the conversation with the customer

To get started with your customers and to make them aware of the products in their catalog and the use cases that align with their goals, follow the Customer Value Acceleration (CVA) guide to conduct a CVA immediately following the signing of the ELA.

If you are joining the account long after the ELA has been signed, or for a shorter meeting with a new ELA customer before the CVA deep dive, you can start the conversation using the EBR template. There are several optional sections in the template that you can use for an early introduction to your customer and to introduce them to their ELA catalog.

### Use the Executive Business Review (EBR) template

An Executive Business Review (EBR) is a periodic review with the customer executive sponsors and IBM. The EBR reinforces the progress the customer is making in their adoption and allows alignment with the customer’s strategic objectives.


<br/>

There is a single EBR template for CS Account Specialists on Diamond ELA accounts that can be used for multiple purposes. How you prepare for your EBR depends on where you are in the process and on your role.

* **Kick off the conversation.** If you are a CS Account Specialist, you can use the EBR template to hold an initial meeting with your executive sponsor.
You can easily adapt the EBR template to start your conversation by reviewing existing ELA deployment projects, discussing potential new deployment opportunities, and creating a deployment plan (project working sheet/action plan). This meeting typically takes more than one hour.
<br/>

* **EBR Quarterly meetings with an executive sponsor.** Similar to the way a Speciality Architect would hold an EBR to reinforce progress and align strategy, a CS Account Specialist can use the EBR template to meet with customer sponsors to understand ELA progress and align on strategic initiatives.

* The CS Brand Architect can use the same EBR template with a specific business unit with one specific line of business.
<br/>

**Summary of outcomes:**<br/>
* Share a common understanding of contract content aligned to customer initiatives and IT strategy.<br/>
* Gain consensus on active initiative progress, risks and actions to eliminate those risks.<br/>
* Gain consensus on new initiatives and actions to progress to the next stage.<br/>
* Update a shared action plan with the customer by project.<br/>
* Identify any issues and owners so they can be promptly addressed

## Next steps

* Review the outputs of your first EBR meeting with the customer.<br/>
* Update the strategic account plan (Quip) and the deployment plan (format determined by CSM and account team) to progress opportunities in the upcoming two quarters based on those outputs.<br/>
* Document/update the “deployment roadmap”<br/>
   - Success plans in Gainsight
   - ISC deployment opportunities<br/>

Your deployment plan should include:<br/>
* The list of ongoing and new deployment opportunities and projects<br/>
* Value propositions for the solutions identified in previous steps<br/>
* Growth plans<br/>
* Risk assessments<br/>
* Use cases for deployment of “at risk” software and undeployed catalog

## Use the Customer Value document to show the value of the Diamond ELA

Use the Customer Value Acceleration document to transition the customer relationship from pre-sales negotiation and signing to post-sales value creation. The document can also provide customers with a resource to navigate through the IBM Software entitlements.

## Customer reporting - Active use, POCs, and sizings

Depending on the customer’s contract terms and conditions, some are required to report their active use to IBM regularly, which will consume some of their catalog entitlement.  Some customers might download and do PoC-type activities with IBM without a financial impact on their ELA, while for others, downloading and doing a POC in their environment uses some of their catalog entitlement.

For Diamond customers, you can use CADET to size the dollar value of a deployment. For the customer’s view of the value of a drawdown from their catalog, use the CADET External Customer View only. For IBM internal deployment value for use in deployment opportunity pipeline and forecasting, use the IBM Internal Transaction Rate (Trans PPQ). Do not share any internal pricing or any data from the Diamond DMS dashboard in CADET with a customer.

 It is highly recommended that customers use a tool called ESMT (Enterprise Software Management Tool) to track ELA deployments and automate their required deployment reporting to IBM.  ESMT provides clients with visibility to their ELA inventory and drawdowns and enables automated deployment reporting to IBM. This free web portal hosted by IBM provides an alternative to time-consuming spreadsheets to track and report ELA software usage for all types of ELAs and substitution contracts.  The interface is simple and proven with customizable features and has over one hundred satisfied ELA customers world-wide.  Check out the ESMT marketing page for more information, and share the link with your customer.  Or reach out to the ESMT team for a demo using the internal contacts link.

## IASP - IBM Authorized Software Asset Management Provider

Some customers have contracted with an authorized Business Partner to perform audit-ready ELA deployment reporting to fulfill audit requirements.  For more information about this program, see the included links. Note that participating in the IASP program does not absolve the customer from sending their regular ELA deployment reports to the Deployment Project Office (DPO) per the terms of their ELA contract.

## ELAs, renewals, and billing

About 90% of ELAs are closed out and a new ELA is signed before the ELA end date. This often occurs on an ELA’s anniversary (renewal/billing) date. Be aware of both dates by looking in the Summary section of your Gainsight relationship. The ELA end date is the expiration of the contract and the last date the contract could end. Contract changes are most likely to occur on the renewal/billing date. Anytime there is a contract change, there is a risk for new and different revenue allocations against the products.

Because you engage with the customer, you should be actively building demand for new content in the next ELA.  You should be engaged with the account team and dealmaker, adding value to the next deal’s creation.

If you are new to the account, in the months leading up to the renewal/billing date you should interlock with your renewal counterpart to understand:
*	Is there any expected change to the current ELA?
*	Will the customer be signing a new ELA early?
*	If so, what is driving the change?
