## I need help with a Partner

Many Cloud Pak Platform CSMs are assigned to entitlements that have a Strategic Partner. That Partner could be involved through the sale as a software reseller, within service delivery on a statement of work or through joint deployment implementation on behalf of a client.

CSMs might need help with that partner, either in making the initial connection, assessing the background on a sale, working through a deployment, or even aligning training for a client.  In the U.S., CSMs have a direct path from Gainsight to ask for help.

U.S. CSMs can now request assistance using the CSM Assist CTA with a Reason of Partner Assistance in Gainsight.

Examples of strategic Partner types in scope are:

Software Resellers (VAR) -  Converge, Mainline, Sirius<br/>
Software Distributors (VAD) - Arrow, Ingram Micro, TD Synnex/Avnet<br/>
Alliance Hyperscalers - AWS, Azure<br/>
Other Strategic Partners - RedHat, IBM Consulting<br/>

## How do I request assistance with a Partner?

Cloud Pak Platform CSMs can create a Partner Assist CTA:

1. Log into Gainsight.
2. Navigate to the Relationship with which you need assistance, and select Cockpit.  (Note: you can also use the main Cockpit from the left Gainsight menu, but it is more convenient to create the CTA from within the Relationship because the Company and Relationship values will be filled in for you.)
Click Create CTA (upper right).
3. Enter a name for the CTA such as a brief summary of the help needed.
4. Select the Owner name as appropriate. See the section below for guidance.
5. Change the Type to "CSM Assist"
6. Set the Reason of "Partner Assistance"
7. Set the Due Date and Priority fields to values that make sense for your situation.
8. Explain your request in the Comments field
9. Click on the Add More Details to expand the Partner Assistance Required Fields
10. Select the Partner name from the Partner drop down
11. Select the Reason most appropriate for your request
12. Leave the Status as New and click Save.
