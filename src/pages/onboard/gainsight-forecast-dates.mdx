## Forecasting key dates

In the FORECAST INFORMATION section, enter your best guess as to when key stages of the project will be reached.  Enter a date as soon as you have a projection and revise the dates as you work through the project.

Select the Deployment Type as soon as you know if the use case is for the initial deployment, will use additional licenses, or will not require additional licenses such as for an upgrade.

* Initial deployment: The first deployment reported for the client running a production workload that is using licenses of that product.
* Additional deployment: An additional use case running in a production environment that uses more licenses than the number used by the use case for the initial deployment.
* No additional licenses used: An upgrade or evolution of a use case that does not result in additional licenses consumed by the client for that product.

Your manager must submit a forecast of the number of deployments for each quarter.  Forecasting your dates accurately gives your manager insight into what the forecast should be.  The more accurate your dates - and up to date your plan is - the better your manager's forecast will be.

### IBM Public Cloud

The IBM Public Cloud team is required to forecast their clients' monthly usage each quarter, which Leadership then uses to make quarterly revenue projections.  A report is available on the Geo Leadership dashboard that displays monthly forecasts and quarterly actuals.

This process is implemented in Gainsight via a Forecast CTA which is sent to the IBM Cloud CSMs before the start of each quarter. You can learn more on the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/gainsight-user-community/education/ibm-cloud#forecastCTA' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Cloud page</a>.

## What key dates are available in Gainsight?

| Field | Description | Stage | When to set |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Sponsor confirmed | The date you expect to have gained customer sponsorship and jointly agree to move forward with the project. | After the customer sponsor is on board and agrees to work with you on deployment, set the stage to Sponsored (if project is approved but on hold) OR to Planning (project is approved and moving forward) | When to set: Set during the Propose stage, if not before. |
| Installation date | The date you expect the customer to have installed the offering in a non-production environment (e.g. development, sandbox, etc.) | After installation is complete, set the stage to Deploying | Set during the Planning stage, if not before. |
| Production go-live | The date you expect the offering and use case to be installed and operational in a production environment. | After the production install is complete, set the stage to Deployed. Set the status to Closed and document the outcome in the Plan Closure section. | Set during the Planning stage, if not before. |
| Stretch Forecast | If your Production Go-Live date is in the current quarter but there is a chance that the project will be delayed into a future quarter, set the Stretch Forecast box to "true".  This indicates that there is risk with this forecast production go-live date. | | |
