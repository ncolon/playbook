Writing a good customer demo is more than just stepping people through the features and functions of your product.  When building an engaging demo, you need to make it memorable.  One way to do that is to make your demo or presentation tell a story.

The story needs to apply the value of the IBM offerings to the customer’s specific needs or industry.

## Learn from Louis Richardson's <a href="http://creativitycrisis.com/newblog/vids/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>YOU the Master Storyteller</a> (former IBMer) 

The following information, summarized from a video by Louis Richardson, talks you through the how’s and why’s of creating a demo that your customer will remember.

The first important thing to understand is what not to do.  Do not simply create a bulleted list of product facts and features and step through them one by one.  Without putting the facts and features into some sort of memorable context, your customer will not remember them even a few hours later.

Instead of simply educating your customer, entertain and enchant them by telling a story.  Stories help carry meaning.  Connect the information to stories you already know.  These stories help people remember what you want them to know.  Subtlety works.  Get your audience to come to their own conclusion.  Make them feel smart. People will never forget how you make them feel!

Ask this question when you leave every call with a customer - What is the feeling I left them with?

Be sure to include these elements to craft a good story:

* Give a time and a place.
   * Don’t make the audience guess the basic facts.  Guessing distracts them as you tell your story.
* Include connected events.
   * Do not add extra things that do not have importance or a purpose. – Everything in the story must have a purpose.
   * Describe what happened. Add descriptive details to make people see what you are talking about.
   * Describe the actions – make people feel.
   * Answer the question - Why do they care?
* Use people and dialog.
* Make sure the story has an insight, something your customer did not know.  Identify the insight that wraps up the story ending first, then craft the middle of the story to build up to the insight.

Watch the beginning of Louis Richardson’s video to see a great example of using storytelling to demonstrate features and functions of products.
