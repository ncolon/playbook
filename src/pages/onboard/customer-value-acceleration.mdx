## What is Customer Value Acceleration (CVA)?

The CVA is an interactive document that describes the value a customer can realize from their Diamond ELA catalog. The CVA document is used in a session with the customer to help explain the value of their catalog and to discover deployment opportunities.

Based on your knowledge of the customer and their contract, the customized CVA document will include links to relevant IBM product sites to make it easier for customers to understand the value of the products contained within their Diamond ELA across a range of capability areas. Additionally, this resource provides a host of useful information around support, key account contacts (eg Deployment Project Office), IBM tools (eg Passport Advantage), and the Reporting requirement.

It is important to know that the true value of the CVA is in the conversations and relationships it initiates. After the customer is made aware of the almost unlimited potential the software in their contract can hold, you can use this experience to launch future use case discovery, deployment workshops, expansion, and ultimately renewal.

## When should I hold a CVA session?

You will start to prepare the customized CVA and get ready to hold a CVA session with your customer right after the contract is signed. This session creates a bridge from the sales experience into an understanding of how to realize value from the deployment and use of IBM solutions. Use the CVA template and customize it to reflect the key initiatives identified during the sales cycle and account planning. Identify where IBM solutions included in the ELA can accelerate value to the customer.

## Who is responsible for creating the CVA?

The CS Account Specialist is responsible for creating and customizing the CVA. It is the CS Account Specialist who needs to drive home the value of the products in the Diamond ELA catalog and understand the potential use cases, renewal, and expansion opportunities.

## How do I prepare for a CVA session?

To prepare for a CVA session, you will need to create the CVA document and ensure you have the IBM Account team and the right set of attendees from the customers. Use the template provided to help you gather all the required product links.

### Inputs and Outputs of the CVA

| Inputs | Outputs |
| -------- | -------- |
| CADET contract data <br/> Deployment Plan <br/> Executive Summary from the Large Deal Workshop<br/> CVA Template | Completed CVA Document that includes the customer's interests and goals and links to the product pages that support them <br/> CVA Session with Customer <br/> Use Case Discovery session <br/> CVA Scorecard |

### Prepare for a successful CVA session

Prepare for the session by gathering information from the meetings and documents listed here.<br/>

**Start** with an internal meeting with the Deal Maker, the Account Technical Leader (ATL) and the Technical Leader (TSL). Use this meeting to align on an understanding of the overall contract and sections, your customer's pain points, and how the IBM technology available in their catalog can help solve them.<br/>

**Review** the ”External Customer View” dashboard in CADET. Be sure you have a solid understanding of the contract sections and details (Aggregate Cap, UEL, Fixed Section details, etc) as well as the products included in the contract.<br/>

**Research** the industry. Be sure you have a handle on the challenges in the field and the competitive landscape.<br/>

**Categorize** the product links. There can be approximately 3,000 products available in the catalog. You will need to categorize the CVA presentation document so the customer can more easily understand the capabilities that can address their business needs. The document can also include links that provide the names of the best people to talk to about the products.<br/>

**Include** the right set of product links based on the Template and the customer's known goals. These links should make the customer's job much easier as they try to understand the value of the catalog.<br/>

**Customize** the CVA document with the customer's logo (from CADET’s External Customer View) and colors that reflect the customer's branding and images from their industry. The more customized the document, the more the customer can relate.<br/>

**Include** the executive summary from the Large Deal Workshop.<br/>

**Present** the products that have already been deployed from the CADET External Customer View.  Include the use cases that the customer is deploying or plans to deploy.

**Summarize** the contract (from the Account team). You should include only those views found in the CADET External Customer View that represent what the customer can see in the Contract. Do not include any views outside of those in CADET External Customer View. (Do not include any CADET Diamond Management System Dashboard/DMS views as these are IBM Confidential). Focus on the capabilities.


## Who participates?

| IBM | Customer |
| --------- | -------- |
| CS Account Specialist Program Manager<br/>Account Technical Leader (ATL)<br/>Deal Maker<br/>Technical Leader | Business Sponsor<br/>Work with the IBM account team to ensure you include the right set of decision makers. |

## Steps to hold the session

After preparing the CVA document and meeting with the IBM Account team to ensure the team is in alignment, you can meet with the customer to start to describe the great benefit their catalog can provide.

Step 1: Schedule the session or ask that the ATL set up the meeting with the customer. Be sure all the right players from the customer are included.

Step 2: Invite brand reps to present the product capabilities.

Step 3: Identify new pipeline opportunities surfaced during the CVA session and create the growth plan in Gainsight and opportunities in ISC as directed by your management.


## Next steps

Over time, continue to develop the deck based on your customer's needs and interests.
You should identify any new pipeline opportunities discussed during the CVA session. A useful next step can include an updated Roadmap.
