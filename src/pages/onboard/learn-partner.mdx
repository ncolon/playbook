You have been assigned a new partner … now what? Whether you are covering a build, sell, service or Blue partner, you need to find out as much as possible about your new partner. You need to understand:
*	Your partner's entitlements.
*	How your partner does business with IBM.
* What the partner offers.

## Before you begin

1.	Locate the CEID associated with your partner. If your partner is in the CS Premier Program, use the <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/o7h0q9lq30ju8tyjmrm3l2r7nf3ng8se' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Participation report</a> to locate your partner’s information. For GSIs/SIs not in the program, explore the BP Capabilities reports.
2.	Locate the GBGID and DBGIDs for your partner. This will help you identify the entitlements your partner purchased from IBM.
3.	Determine whether your partner has an ELA or ESA and is in the <Link to='/onboard/ELA/#is-my-customer-in-the-diamond-program'>Diamond program</Link>. These are typically GSIs and Blue partners.  (Note: not all ELA and ESA customers/partners are part of the Diamond program)

## Understand partner entitlements

In Gainsight, you can find entitlements sold by and sold to your partner. 

*	**For partners in the CS Premier Program** (primarily Sell partners), use Partner Specialist: Reseller Partner CSM dashboard to view the entitlements sold by your partner. This includes all IBM Software and is not limited to CSM-covered products. 
* **For Build and Blue (Embed) partners** you can view your partner in a way that is similar to the way you would view customers in Gainsight. For this, the GBGID and DBGIDs are useful to locate the correct entitlements. Review the C360 and associated R360s for your partner.  In the R360s, Entitlement Detail tab, you can identify the entitlements that the partner is authorized to embed in the solution that they will bring to market. In this case, the Channel Distribution Code is K.
* **For Service partners (GSIs/SIs)**
  * Start with entitlements sold TO your partner. 
    - If your partner is in the Diamond program because they have an ELA with reporting requirements, follow the Diamond program guidance.  
    - If the partner is not in the Diamond program, research entitlements by GBGID (or DBGID for country-specific entitlements).
    - Depending on the terms of the agreement, these entitlements may be used for 1) internal projects or 2) customer projects managed by the GSI/SI.
  * Next, review any entitlements sold BY your partner. These entitlements are likely sold to end customers for whom the GSI/SI is providing implementation assistance. 
*	**For Blue Hyperscaler Partners** (AWS and Microsoft) you will view your partner similar to the way you would view customers in Gainsight. For this, the GBGID and DBGIDs are useful to locate the correct entitlements. Review the C360 and associated R360s for your partner.  You will also want to use Gainsight to locate where entitlements have been sold to customers through the Hyperscaler marketplace. An easy way to do this is to use the Search: All Companies by Name and filter the VAR column, e.g., “AWS Marketplace”. You can apply additional filters to narrow down to a particular geography or market.

## Understand the partner’s business with IBM

There are several ways to explore the partner’s business with IBM.

### Review BP Capabilities reports

To access the reports, visit the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/partnerplus/bp-capabilities' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>BP Capabilities publisher page</a>. Click on the desired report name. The report will run and download as an Excel file to your local computer. Open the file in Excel. 

**Proficiency Badges by Business Partner**
In the Partner Plus program, a proficiency is earned by having the same individual complete both the sales foundation and technical sales intermediate badges within a proficiency group. Each Partner Plus tier requires that the firm hold a certain number of proficiencies – Gold requires 7 proficient individuals while Platinum requires 14. 

To find the number of proficiencies for a certain partner: 
*	View the Prof. Grps Count by CEID tab. 
*	Highlight the header row and turn on spreadsheet filters. 
*	Filter Col B by CEID or Col C by BP Name (if you use name, add an additional filter on country.
*	Scroll to the right to which learning they have participated in and how many individuals have completed sales and technical badges to arrive at the number of “proficient” individuals. 
*	Name-level detail is never provided in these reports due to privacy protections. 

**Company Lookup Report**
This report is mostly used to discover the Partner Plus tier of a partner and which motions (build, sell, service) they have transacted with IBM.  Once you download the report:
* Review the Read Me tab instructions for important information about the data and/or use of the data.
* Go to the PRM Company Lookup tab and highlight the header row and turn on spreadsheet filters. Filter by Col F by CEID. 
*	Scroll to the right to view the relevant data. 
    * Col L “Program Tier” is the current Partner Plus tier. 
    * Col M provides you the achieved tier. 
    *  Tiers are assessed annually and if achieved is lower than current, the partner may be at risk of dropping tiers at the next validation, expected after the end of the calendar year. Remember that Partner Plus tiers are associated with the WWE ID. So, if one country entity is relatively small, they might still have Platinum level benefits if earned by an entity in another country.
* If you are working with a GSI, Col J “GSI WWE Group” may also be helpful to show you all the entities associated with your assigned GSI.  

### Review the ISC Ecosystem Dashboards

Start with the <a href='https://ibmsc.my.salesforce.com/analytics/wave/dashboard?assetId=0FK3h000000RQj3GAG&orgId=00D3h000004YkeY&loginHost=na111.salesforce.com&urlType=sharing&pageId=05ecf617-d100-4bdd-9345-967d12034ab4&savedViewId=8wk3h000000TuMYAA0&analyticsContext=analyticsTab' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Partner Performance Dashboard</a>, filtering by the Partner name and relevant geography and markets. You can add filters such as Major Unit to see only the IBM Software opportunity rather than all of IBM. 

Scroll through the dashboard to view their strengths across markets, portfolio area, and even their Top 50 Accounts.

### Talk to the Ecosystem sales team

Things to ask the Ecosystem sales team:

* Do they have an account/partner plan in Quip? Request access. Eventually, you will want to contribute to this plan to document the deployment strategies and related objectives and actions for your partner. 
*	What makes up the partner’s primary business with IBM? Is it largely infrastructure? Largely software? Or a balance of both?
*	Are they primarily an IBM partner or do they do significant business with our competitors as well?
*	What is the partner’s primary technical capability? Do they offer services or are they simply a procurement partner?
*	Does the partner have key alliances with other partners?
*	Is the partner a Technology Expert Labs (TEL) strategic partner? Do they deliver services on behalf of TEL as a subcontractor?
*	Are there strategic agreements in place between IBM and the partner to drive specific revenue outcomes? (These are referred to as Custom Growth Investments (CGIs).) What are the agreements? When do the agreements expire? Is the partner on track to achieve the targets established?
*	How is the IBM relationship with the partner? What are some recent successes and/or concerns? 
*	Does the partner have prior experience with IBM Customer Success? What has that experience been like?

## Understand what the partner offers

One of the best ways to get current information about your partner is to search the web. Look at their latest quarterly earnings and any recent press releases. Have there been any recent acquisitions announced? Look at the About Us section on their website. This will often tell you what vendors they work with in addition to IBM. 

This information, combined with the information gathered through internal reports and sales team insight will help you establish a starting point for your new partner relationship. 

## Next steps

Reach out to the partner to establish a collaborative way of working together. See <Link to='/onboard/business-partner/#how-to-find-a-partner-contact'>How to find a partner contact</Link>
