## View opportunities and track progression

Get engaged as a deal is closing to ensure a seamless client experience.  In doing so there is no need for the client to repeat information, but rather a seamless shift of knowledge across the IBM team.
To accelerate your time to adoption, in ISC a report has been created as a starting point for you to create your own.

By default the report shows any deals that are in the Negotiate, Closing or Closed status for the current month and the previous month.  The columns give you key insights:

* Product Name - the product that is on the opportunity.  Look to ensure the product name is part of our CSM covered offerings.
* Product Family - Get insight if the customer is purchasing a SaaS, Subscription License (SW Subscription), Perpetual license (Software), or even Technology Expert Labs (SW Services).
* Client Use Case - Get insight on what the customer is trying to do with the product.  If it is blank, engage the sellers to document it.

### Editing the report

In the upper right corner of the report, Select the **Edit** pull down and click **Save as** to save the report.  Provide a unique name and select the folder **Private Reports**.

After you have forked the report, click **Edit** and you will see a new pane on the left side of the UI.  This pane has 2 tabs, Outline and Filter:
**Outline** The columns shown in the report.<br/>
**Filters** Views specific to you.

Filters to consider:

* Geography - Americas, EMEA, APAC or Japan
* Market - similar to Gainsight, recommend using Contains
* Coverage Name - for those aligned with specific squads, filter on your squad name
* Products - By default this includes the offerings that drive assignment to focus there, but feel free to modify as desired.
* Close date - Date range the opportunity is to close
