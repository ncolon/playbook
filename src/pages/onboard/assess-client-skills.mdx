## Assess customer skills

Your engagement with the customer is based on co-creation. To ensure a successful outcome, you need to assess your customer's skill level on the technology they are adopting.  When there are skill gaps, you will need to create an enablement plan. Be sure to include the customer's Partner in the planning, if applicable.

**Build an enablement plan for the customer that focuses on "just in time" learning. You can continue to add to the enablement plan as you co-create with the customer and find additional skill gaps. **

  * Run a bootcamp session with the customer to help up-skill.

  * Share digital education from IBM and Red Hat.

**Consider positioning Technology Expert Labs or Business Partner services to run enablement sessions.**

   * If your customer is not already engaged with a Partner and prefers to work with one, reach out to the Business Partner Seller (BPS) in your market/territory to discuss the opportunity and pass the lead to the right partner.
