## Engage the business and technical sponsors

Your business sponsor is responsible for driving innovation and change within the company.
Not having identified a sponsor is one of the biggest derailment factors. You need to ensure you build the bridge to your sponsor as early as possible in the process.

If a sponsor was not developed during the sales cycle, use your knowledge of the customer, their industry, and their offering to identify possible roles to engage. Ask the IBM team to introduce you to individuals in those roles.

Note: If a Business Partner is involved, be sure to work with them upfront to discuss how you will collaborate to support this customer. It is essential to do so in order to avoid any channel contention. Once you have that mutual understanding, then engage the customer and be clear about your respective roles and value in the relationship.
