## Learn from the Transition Document

In the best of all worlds, your Client Engineering, ATL, or Seller cohorts have completed the Transition document.
You can check the recently closed opportunity in ISC to see if the team has provided a link in the next steps.
If not, you can always use the template to help drive the conversation with the account team and capture it as you discuss with them.  Encourage them to use it for the next deal.
You can find the template in <a href='https://ibm.quip.com/account/login?next=https%3A%2F%2Fibm.quip.com%2FeCY1Al56yJae%2FIBM-Quip-HomePage' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Quip.</a>

The Transition Document is designed to ensure we do not lose momentum with our customers as they purchase our products and move from the pre-sales to post-sales engagement model.

We do not appear to be a single Team IBM when a customer is asked to repeat information they have already shared with the IBM team.
CSMs engage as deals are closing to accelerate deployment.  By understanding what drove the deal and the key stakeholders, CSMs can build growth plans to achieve value.

There is a benefit for pre-sales as well. The ATL and Seller can get deeper client insight as the CSM develops their client growth plans, which inform the Account Plan and Client Technical Strategy.
This can accelerate time for expansion through qualified expansion leads passed by the CSM to sellers following successful deployments.

### When to complete the Transition Document?

The Transition Document is appropriate for any Opportunity. It is never too early for the team to capture insights.
The document should be created and team members added during the Design phase of an opportunity.

As the deal progresses, the entire team documents key insights, engagements or decision points. There is no need to wait until the deal is won.
Complete the transition document as the opportunity moves from Negotiate into Closing.

### Who participates in the Transition Document?
