Use this set of questions to ensure you have all the information you need to prepare for a conversation with your customer.

## General ELA contract

* Contract start/end dates
* All software sections and terms:  Fixed, Catalogs, Subscription, UEL, Substitution
* Does this augment, alter, or replace (terminate) any prior contracts?
* What was the total cost?  What is the catalog cap?
* Who signed the contract and what is their role?
* Why did they sign the ELA?  What is their ROI and expected value?
* What other software do they own outside of the ELA?

## Deployment and reporting for Diamond ELAs

* Diamond reporting clause requirements and frequency
* When was the last report collected?  How regularly do they report?
* Deployment status – what has already been deployed, what brands, and what quantities?  What % of the catalog is used?
* Deployment pipeline – what projects are in the current pipeline?

## Understand current ELA governance

* Who (at the customer's) is talking about the ELA regularly? And how often?
* Who is monitoring usage/deployment?
* What is their internal reporting process?
* Who from IBM is talking about it regularly with the customer? Are you holding an Executive Business Review (EBR) quarterly?
