## Reservation policies

IBM Technology Zone's reservation forms will show you how long you can reserve an environment.
By selecting a "Customer Demo", "Proof of Concept", or "Proof of Technology" purpose and providing a valid IBM Sales Cloud or Gainsite relationship ID you will be alloted more time on the intial reservation form. The lowest cost options allot more time for customer facing or self-education purposes. For more details, refer to the <a href='https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/reservation-duration-policy.md' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>runbook</a>.

**Education/Testing** – preparing for a demo or learning IBM Technology - does not require an opportunity code<br/>
**Customer Facing** (Demo, POC, POT, MVP) – requires an active opportunity code
