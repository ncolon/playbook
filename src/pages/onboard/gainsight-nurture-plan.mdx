## Your customer is not ready for a new use case

The Nurture Plan defines activities you will take with your customer until they are ready to deploy a new use case.  This plan is only available for Sustainability Software, Cognos Analytics SaaS, Planning Analytics SaaS, and IBM Cloud->CDP on Cloud.


## When should I create a Nurture Plan?

Create a nurture plan when your customer needs time before working on a new use case. Use the plan to track your activities, including advocacy, regular check-ins, monitoring usage, etc.

Examples of when a nurture plan is appropriate:

* The customer recently deployed a large installation or upgrade and needs time to use the new solution.
* It is a long-term customer who is maintaining their solution but not yet growing.
* The customer is under audit or waiting for a new fiscal budget.


If you are not sure that your customer is using or have not deployed their entitlement, you can create a <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Growth Plan</Link> to figure this out.  If you find that they are using the entitlement, then a nurture plan might be appropriate - or a new growth plan to help them expand.  If they're not deployed, either create a new growth plan or expand your original growth plan to deploy.  If they're not planning to use the entitlement, you might need a <Link to='/expand-renew/what-is-retention-plan' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Retention Plan</Link> or <Link to='/expand-renew/create-defection-plan' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Defection Report</Link>.

## Once you have built your plan...

Review your plan with your manager so that they understand why a nurture plan is in place.<br/>

Update the plan at least monthly with Timeline activities.<br/>

Follow through on the objectives - you want to continue to engage your customer and drive towards a new use case.<br/>

Continue to think about use case ideas and document them as growth plans for when the customer is ready to move forward.

<Aside>

Only create Nurture plans for deployed entitlements.<br/><br/>

If you don't know if your customer has deployed the entitlement, create a growth plan with the goal of finding this out.<br/><br/>

Update Nurture plans at least monthly and review them after 6 months. Your goal is to drive new deployments.<br/><br/>

While you're nurturing the customer - think about new ideas for use cases and document them as draft, Identified growth plans.<br/><br/>

Remember:  The ultimate goal of the nurture plan is to move the customer to a new deployment!  Nurture plans are temporary by design.

## Get started

Before you begin, ask yourself:  Has this entitlement already been deployed?  If not, you need a growth plan.

Nurture plans should span no longer than 6 months.  Ensure you can clearly articulate the reason for a nurture plan and not a growth plan.

Best Practice:  Give your plan a descriptive name so that people will know at a glance why you are creating a nurture plan.

## Build the plan

The nurture plan is concise by design.  Use the description field to explain why you're doing a nurture plan, outline your goals, and the steps you're taking to guide the customer to a new deployment use case.

Set your meeting cadence up front - and stick to it!

Best Practice:  Update your nurture plan at least once a month by making Timeline entries and updating your Objectives.

## Apply the Nurture Plan template

Standard nurturing activities have been loaded into a template for ease of use. Apply the template to your plan and it will populate your Objectives tab with activities that you can follow.  Customize these objectives by updating dates, descriptions and owners if needed.  You may also add your own objectives.

Your plan should be driving to closure after a max of 6 months.

Best Practice:  Edit the standard objectives to make the plan meet the needs of your customer and their situation.

## Close the plan

After your plan is complete, provide details on what happened.

Reflect on the outcome - did the plan work or not?  Why not?
What actions led to positive results?  What actions did not work as expected?
Did the customer provide feedback?  Capture it here so that we can all learn from the experience and make changes for the future.

Best Practice:  Document both success and failures.  Every plan is a good resource for future efforts.
