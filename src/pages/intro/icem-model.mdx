The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC3dHjbMmgCf78QJ2QdFbTDg2693' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Client Engagement Model (ICEM)</a> is the single IBM sales approach for engaging with clients to drive consistency and enhanced business results. All teams execute the model in alignment with the client's transformation journey. 

ICEM has three phases of customer engagement:

<Row>

<Column colMd={3} colLg={3}>

**Plan:** Map client goals and strategies to IBM technology and sales plays.
</Column>

<Column colMd={3} colLg={3}>

**Progress:** Propose a compelling reason to act, negotiate terms and prices, and close a sales opportunity.
</Column>

<Column colMd={3} colLg={3}>

**Deliver:** Deliver value on the client expectations identified in the planning phase.

<Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>

<br/>

As a CSM, your impact is greatest in the Deliver phase; however, you need to engage with the Account team before the Close of a sale to share your knowledge of the client and so you have a better understanding of what is sold. You have input in the Design phase of the Sales cycle.

## Adoption Engagement Model

The Deliver phase is focused on delivering value on the client expectations that were identified in the planning phase.
This means successful implementation and adoption to ensure the client can quantify the business
value of their purchase decision. Client retention and loyalty are the levers that provide
additional opportunities to scale and expand.

## Transition from the Progress phase to the Deliver phase

The three phases of the ICEM are Plan, Progress, and Deliver. The progression from the Progress to the Deliver phase is a transition from Pre-sales to post-sales. You will engage in some planning activities in pre-sales where you provide deployment status to the IBM team during this transition period. You will also use this time to learn about the customer and their goals.

| Activity |
| ------- |
| Participate in **<Link to='/onboard/strategic-account-planning'>Account Planning</Link>**. This pre-sales activity results in a living, internal business plan. You are responsible for completing the Account Technology Plan template section in Quip named Deployment Strategy. Ensure that the plan owner shares access with you so you have permission to view and update the plan. |
| Participate in the **Large Deal Workshop**. This pre-sales activity for Diamond clients results in a dynamic working document completed by the account team that focuses on customer and internal IBM objectives. |
| The **<Link to='/onboard/transition-doc'>Transition Document</Link>** is designed to ensure CS does not lose momentum with our clients as they purchase our products and move from the pre-sales to post-sales engagement model. If you are covering a partner, you will ensure the Partner has a transition process. |
| **High-level deployment plan** In Gainsight, the deployment plan is called the <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Growth Plan</Link>. Based on the information you have gathered from the IBM Account team or Partner, you should be able to start to develop this plan after you have an initial use case. |

After the product is sold and you are in the Deliver phase, you will work within Gainsight to manage your activities and you will follow the <Link to='/deploy/document-the-plan'>Deployment Stages</Link>
