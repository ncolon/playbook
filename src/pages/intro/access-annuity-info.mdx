## Access renewal information in ISC

Use the information in ISC to identify and engage with your Subscription and Annuity rep.

To access renewal information in ISC, follow these steps:

1. Log into ISC and find your customer.
2. After you find your customer in ISC, and open the account, click on the **Related** tab.
3. On this tab, scroll down to the **Opportunities** area of the window. Under Opportunity Names, scan for any names that include **Renewal** in the name. These are your renewal opportunities.

4. All S&S renewals are named following this convention:

| S&S renewals name format | Example |
| --- | ----|
|   mm/yy Renewal Customer name | 2022-09-"Renewal"- EARLY WARNING SERVICES, LLC-US-0003223307 |

All S&S opportunities after August 2022 are included in ISC.

All Subscription and SaaS renewals use the following convention:

| Subscription and SaaS renewals name format | Example |
| --- | ----|
| Q322-SLR(Subscription License Renewal) (or SaaS)_MaaS_Load-Charge agreement # | Q322- SLR_MaaS_Load - SA#77452622-DIRECT- |

6. When you select the Opportunity, you will see the Opportunity owner listed here. This is the Subscription and Annuity rep who is responsible for pursuing the opportunity.

## What was sold and what is up for renewal

1. You will see multiple products listed under Products (This is intended to simplify billing for customers).
The product is listed using the Unified Taxonomy Level 30 name. The UT30 name is one level higher than the
product name the client has purchased.

3. Click on the Related tab. You will see the part numbers that are up for renewal.

### Ensure the renewal risk data is accurate

The Gainsight Health Score is available in ISC on the Annuity dashboard on the Renewals at Risk dashboard. Ensure that the renewal risk data sent to ISC from Gainsight is as accurate as possible. The Health Score data is used by the S&A seller to prioritize the opportunities with the greatest level of risk to renewal and they will be looking to you to help explain why a relationship is at risk.
