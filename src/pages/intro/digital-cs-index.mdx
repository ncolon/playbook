## Digital CSM
IBM Digital CSMs own onboard, deployment, adoption and renewal of SaaS software for Select segment accounts at a ratio of 1:100.  The Select GTM is predominantly partner-led and IBM Digital CSMs will engage through partners and directly to ensure customer value with IBM software. 

Digital-led doesnâ€™t mean digital only.  Digital CSMs will proactively engage based on data signals and automated triggers that identify potential risk or expansion candidates.

A Digital CSM performs the following tasks: 
-	Monitors customer usage, ensuring customer progression through onboarding, adoption and renewal.
-	Proactively engages customers who have slow onboarding, slow deployment, declining usage, lack of feature adoption, reached entitlement capacity and other signs of risk or growth.
-	Actively engages in user communities, assisting customers, identifying gaps in self-service technical content and assisting with adjusting digital communication plans accordingly.
