| Gainsight | Is the tool that CSMs use to help customers adopt, use, and obtain maximum value from IBM offerings. In Gainsight, you can access the clients you are assigned to, create your success plans, document key updates, and communicate the health and deployment progress of each client. It provides a central place to capture all account activity, communicate plans, track deployment progression, and track progress against your key metrics. | <a href="http://ibm.biz/client_success">Access Gainsight</a> <br/><br/> <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/gainsight-user-community">Gainsight community</a> <br/><br/> <a href='https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C8ML3GJFP' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Slack the Gainsight community</a> <br/><br/> <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/gainsight-user-community/get-learning">Learn how to use Gainsight</a> <br/><br/> <a href='https://github.ibm.com/hybrid-cloud/gainsight-support/issues/new/choose' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Gainsight support</a> |
| Slack | Allows you to easily collaborate with team members, share expertise, and connect with colleagues across business units. | <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C01HDSKA2RH"> #cs-ibm Customer success slack channel</a> |
| ISC (IBM Sales Cloud) | IBM Sales Cloud (ISC) is IBM's CRM platform powered by Salesforce technology intended to simplify the sales process and improve collaboration. CSMs and CSM Leaders can access ISC to better understand customer activity. <br/> Both sellers and CSMs can use ISC to deepen their knowledge about their customers. <br/> CSMs can use ISC to research customers, connect with sellers, and create expansion opportunities. CSM Managers can research deals about to close to determine if CSM coverage is needed, and view the expansion opportunities created by their CSMs. <br/> If you need help from CE, you can request CE work deployment by entering the request in ISC.

| CADET (Client Adoption Engagement Tracker) | CADET is the official worldwide management system and reporting tool for software deployment.  Specific to the Diamond program, CADET is the single source of truth for contract information, deployment reporting, as well as consolidation of a deployment pipeline. As a CS Account Specialist or Brand Architect, you will use this tool to gain insight into customer reporting sections of their contract, track performance, and have meaningful conversations on risk, opportunities, and actions. <br/> Access to CADET is based on role.  New CS Account Specialists and Brand Architects can request access via CADET support.  | <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/client-success-and-software-adoption/cadet" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>How to use CADET</a> <br/> <br/> <a href='https://github.ibm.com/hybrid-cloud/cadet-support/issues/new/choose' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request access</a>  |

| Case Viewer | IBM Case Viewer is a read-only app that enables you to read Cases in the Cognitive Support Platform (CSP) <br/> Case Viewer is the Salesforce/Merlin Customer Ticket system view for internal IBMers. <br/>In Case Viewer,  the "Resolution Provided" status in Salesforce/Merlin is displayed as "Closed by IBM". Salesforce/Merlin moves these to "Closed - Archived" automatically after 30 days. <br/> There is also a status code of "Closed" in Salesforce/Merlin that displays as "Closed by Client" in Case Viewer. <br/> Gainsight displays the status from Salesforce/Merlin. Support tickets in Gainsight come from a nightly feed, so there is an up to 24-hour lag of updates.| <a href='https://ibm.biz/CaseViewer' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> Access IBM Case Viewer</a> |
