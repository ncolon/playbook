## Who can I call on to help?

There are several teams that you will work with as you engage a customer on a deployment opportunity. Some of these team members are part of the “account team” and are individuals assigned to a particular account that you will be closely collaborating with throughout the customer lifecycle. Other team members are there for you to call on for help.

The TechSales tab in ISC now enables you to create Technical Sales Activity for both CSM-managed (created from Gainsight) and non-CSM-managed Deployment records. Tech Sellers can then use the Activity tab to view, track, and manage these activities as part of their normal management system. | <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/leader-blog/b1ff3d50-76a8-11eb-881c-d1b971ada7e5' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Blog: How CSMs team with Tech Sellers</a> <br/><br/> <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCJhcC389ggPcG4CWGXQFcfTdp4d#/?anchorId=bd0b4b99-1a6c-4321-bfd2-d479a94242d8' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Seismic: Tech sales activities in ISC</a> |
