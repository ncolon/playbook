  <AccordionItem title="What are Containers">

<p>
  Containers are standard unit of software that packages up code and all its
  dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing
  environment to another.
</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
  Containers work by isolating the differences between applications inside the
  container so that everything outside the container can be standardized. This
  makes it easy to move the contained application between environments (dev,
  test, production, etc..) while retaining full functionality.
</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
  Containers are an important part of IT security. By building security into the
  container pipeline and defending the infrastructure, the containers are
  ensured to be reliable, scalable, and trusted.
</p>

### The benefits of containerized applications

<p>
  Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional
  deployment methods. Where applications were once expected to be installed on
  operating systems that included all their dependencies, containers let an
  application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized
  applications offers many benefits.
</p>

#### Operating system benefits

<p>
  Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel.
  Their file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are
  separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the
  hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use
  all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid
  innovation.
</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
  Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy
  applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host.
  Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own
  interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to
  compete for those assets.
</p>

#### Deployment and scaling benefits

<p>
  If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you
  can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain
  compatibility with the current release.
</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
  You can also deploy and test a new version of an application alongside the
  existing version. If the container passes your tests, simply deploy more
  new containers and remove the old ones. 
</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>
  Since all the software dependencies for an application are resolved within the
  container itself, you can use a standardized operating system on each host in
  your data center. You do not need to configure a specific operating system for
  each application host. When your data center needs more capacity, you can deploy
  another generic host system.
</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
Similarly, scaling containerized applications is simple. OpenShift Container Platform offers a simple, standard way of scaling any containerized service. For example, if you build applications as a set of microservices rather than large, monolithic applications, you can scale the individual microservices individually to meet demand. This capability allows you to scale only the required services instead of the entire application, which can allow you to meet application demands while using minimal resources.

## What is RedHat OpenShift

Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for an <Link to="https://www.redhat.com/en/products/open-hybrid-cloud" target="_target">open hybrid cloud</Link> strategy. It provides a consistent application platform to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. This strategy gives developers a common application environment to develop, orchestrate, and run their applications, while giving sysadmins and operations teams a common operating environment to manage their infrastructure. With this consistency across environments you can deliver automated IT infrastructure.

OpenShift extends Kubernetes with built-in authentication and authorization, secrets management, auditing, logging, and container registry for granular, centralized control

### OpenShift Features

#### Automation

- Installation, upgrades, and lifecycle management throughout the container stack – operating system, Kubernetes and cluster services, and applications – on any public/private cloud, VMWare, bare metal
- Auto scaling and health management
- <Link

    target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'

    Operators
  </Link> (a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes-native application)
  provide automation at every level of the stack, from managing the parts that make
  up the platform to applications that are provided as a managed service.

#### Collaboration

- IT operations and developers to effectively deploy containerized applications
- Support for <Link to="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>CI/CD</Link> workflows and pipelines, and integration with CI/CD pipeline and toolchain
- OpenShift is an application platform with a trusted software supply chain
- Management of container images with ImageStreams (e.g. upload a container image once and manage it)
- Provides capability to plug-in any open source or customized tools that customer teams prefer to use

#### Standards based

- Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and the Open Container Initiative (OCI)
- Portability of workloads between onsite, public and private cloud and across an array of systems which run RHEL/RH CoreOS
- Portability of container images built on OCI standard between development, test, and production environments

#### Web scale

- Build, deploy and manage applications at scale on containers without worrying about containers and technical details which in turn allows people to concentrate on business innovation and results
- Scalability, easily scale applications to thousands of instances across hundreds of nodes in a matter of seconds.

#### Open source

- RedHat is the leading Kubernetes contributor since day one
- Use continuous feedback loop to expedite fixes and innovation from customer to community and back to customer

#### Enterprise grade

- Enterprise-grade Linux operating system (RH CoreOS or RHEL)
- Focused on security at every level of the container stack and throughout the application lifecycle, container orchestration and cluster management, and enterprise container host
- Stricter security policies and default configurations out of the box than default Kubernetes
- 24x7 external support organization available for your production application environment via a subscription model
- Operations via OperatorHub including OpenShift certified operators starting in OpenShift 4.0

## An Unified Platform

### Linux, Containers and Kubernetes are the architecture of choice

Containers drive portability and Kubernetes standardizes container management However, cloud provider specific Kubernetes lacks compatibility and integration guarantees (storage, networking, projects supported, etc..)

### Container Management alone is not sufficient

#### Why Red Hat OpenShift?

- Fully integrated and automated architecture
- Seamless Kubernetes deployment on any cloud or on-premises environment
- Fully automated installation, from cloud infrastructure to OS to application services
- One click platform and application updates
- Auto-scaling of cloud resources
- Enterprise-grade security
- Ability to run enterprise workloads, “with enterprise build/manage services”, across all/multiple deployment options (private, public, hybrid/Multicloud).

OpenShift is the leading enterprise Kubernetes platform: RHEL supports any cloud, any virtualization and any hardware and OpenShift provides everything out-of-the-box
