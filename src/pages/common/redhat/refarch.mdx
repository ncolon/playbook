## COMING SOON

- CoreOS > Kubernetes > OpenShift > CloudPak Layer Cake

I could not find clear definition of the Azure resources that get deployed as part of the install. I want visibility into what the installer was going to do before the installer ran, and why canâ€™t I find this information on redhat.com domain?

- Resources Deployed per Cloud: https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocplimitscalculator/
