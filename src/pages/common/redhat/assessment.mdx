## Overview

Our CSM team over in SPGI have created an OpenShift Assessment that has proven to be an effective accelerator in deploying our products into a customer's environment. Wether the customer is starting on their modernization journey, or already has OpenShift deployed, this assessment can help YOU guide your customer into a production ready environment to host our IBM Software.

For existing OpenShift clusters, data is collected via technical interviews and optionally with Sysdig running on IBM Cloud, and the results, along with any applicable recommendations, are presented to the customer.

For customers starting their modernization journey, an introductory session explaining the benefits of modernization, and how OpenShift is poised as the best platform to host their workloads. The results and design recommendations are presented to the customer, as well as an MVP proposal with next steps and additional enablement sessions.
