## What are Intellectual Property (IP) partnerships?

Each IP partnership is unique; however, IBM and these companies have a shared interest in Intellectual Property (IP), in IBM's case, in software IP. The partnership agreements define who can market and sell the products and who is responsible for the development and support of the products. 

## 21CS

They deliver solutions that are fit for mission-critical operations, enabling the success of the IBM Z platform through software innovation based on deep customer and market insight.

### DataKinetics IP products

IBM Z Table Accelerator

<a href='https://www.ibm.com/products/z-table-accelerator' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Z Table Accelerator</a> is jointly owned by IBM and DataKinetics. It is ideal for organizations that need to get every ounce of power out of their mainframe systems in order to maximize performance and transaction throughput, while still minimizing system resource usage at the application level.

It allows for more powerful and efficient applications while lowering mainframe total cost of ownership and reducing operational spend. It can also help to increase the timeframe between upgrade capital expenses.

## HCL

The HCLTech IBM Alliance maximizes the value offered to enterprise clients by imbuing a long-standing strategic global relationship with an enhanced charter - to successfully deliver digital application modernization, integrated application-infrastructure autonomics and orchestration, mainframe transformation, and advanced cognitive capabilities. 

In recent years, HCLTech and IBM have amplified an already multi-faceted, multi-year, ecosystem-centric partnership by forging a 15-year agreement to Digitize, deploy Agile & DevOps methodologies, and automate some of IBM’s most successful flagship products and platforms, thereby ensuring their continued market dominance. Additionally, IBM has accorded HCLTech a premier Global System Integrator (GSI) status that is paving the way for the HCLTech IBM Alliance to jointly occupy a leadership position in Cognitive solutions built on the IBM Watson data platform and application suites. Furthermore, HCLTech is significantly investing in the development of innovative new applications on the IBM Bluemix cloud platform that address fast-growing and emerging technology paradigms including Advanced Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, “X” "-as-a-service, Internet of Things, Cyber Security, and Blockchain.

### How do I get help?
The HCL IPP team is running two programs to support DevOps Automation clients.
-	The DevOps Automation VIP Client Program is a selective invite-only program that provides experienced clients with the opportunity to engage with product development to validate and influence future product direction.
-	The DevOps Automation Stream Revenue Protection Plan is intended to mitigate risk of stream revenue decline by developing, growing, or rekindling relationships among at-risk clients.
