**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

See below for detailed instructions on how to view the usage for your account.

## Overview
As a CSM, your focus is to guide and nurture your customers who have an Instana SaaS entitlement.  Your job is to guide the customer with provisioning through onboarding (install an agent, invite/add users), help with their first use case (create application perspectives, set up alerts), and continue to expand their use cases.

## Post-sales journey <br/>
When a customer converts from a trial to a paid licensed product, a CSM Architect or Digital CSM assigned to the account can digitally welcome and nurture the users along their product journey.  The CSM can take actions based on key milestone events.

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Instana SRE | Instana SaaS instance provisioned and the customer has access. <br/> The Instana SaaS instance is multi-tenant.  The client is required to create an <a href='https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBMid account</a> | **Provisioning the service:** <br/>**Request a 14-day free trial instance**<br/> 1. Click on this link to request an <a href='https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52345' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Instana Observability free trial</a> and create an IBMid. ![Instana SaaS Trial](../images/instana-saas-trial-1.png) <br/> 2. Complete the form and click **Continue**. ![Instana SaaS Trial](../images/instana-saas-trial-2.png) <br/> 3.

Under **My products**, click on the **Upgrade options** link to switch to a paid plan. <br/><br/> **How to request a paid instance if my customer already owns an Instana SaaS entitlement** <br/> For customers who already own an Instana SaaS entitlement, work with the IBM Tech Seller assigned to the account to fill out a license activation form.  They will submit the request to the SRE team to provision an instance.<br/> - Americas: Ryan Strehlke, Masa Kawano, Jimmy Herbert, Bobby Coppersmith, Drew Flower <br/> - EMEA: Michael Nagar <br/> - APAC: Madura Eleperuma <br/> - Japan: Brent Butchard

### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Instana SRE and IBM CSM | Customer has validated access to their Instana SaaS instance using their IBMid, installed an agent and/or invited additional users. | **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:** <br/> <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCMj9fQQ2QP6JGmGWbhcJBdjVBpd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>**Plan Instana**</a> <br/> IBM will review, validate, and understand during a remote discussion with a customer.  A roadmap of adoption implementation recommendations based on customer priorities will be developed for further service opportunities. <br/><br/> **Getting started:** <br/> After the Instana SaaS instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the IBM SaaS console or the link in the provision request email.<br/> Upon the initial sign-in, the user will be prompted to set up their password to access the Instana Console. A customer can configure the instance to use a different access management system but will need to work with support. <br/> The next step is to <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=installing-instana-agents' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>install the agent</a> and Instana will automatically discover and map your services and infrastructure components. |


### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM CSM or Technology Expert Labs | Client is using >50% of the purchased subscription capacity for two consecutive months to be receiving value and considered "deployed". | **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:** <br/> **Build Instana** Coming soon <br/><br/> **Use the solution:** <br/> CSMs should utilize billable services from Technology Expert Labs to observe the applications and infrastructure components required by the customer. <br/> CSMs that have customers that want to use Instana SaaS without the support of Technology Expert Labs will need to provide support themselves using the resources available in the <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook-staging/playbook/common/automation/csm-automation-instana/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Instana playbook</a> or <a href='https://instana-demo-development.5a8cbfd1.public.multi-containers.ibm.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>experience Instana</a> by going through a walk-through demo. |

### Confirm Value & Expand

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM CSM | Customer has realized value and expanding usage to new business units | **Nuture relationship:** <br/>Set up a <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/executive-business-review/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>EBR (executive business review)</a> with client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen and confirm the customer's strategic goals have been met. <br/><br/> **Expand solution** <br/> A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services and look for opportunities to add more use cases. |

### Renewed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM CSM and/or Technical Sales | The client has confirmed that they are using the product and will continue to renew their entitlement. | N/A |
