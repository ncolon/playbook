**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

See below for detailed instructions on how to view the usage for your account.

## Overview

IBM API Connect Essentials as a Service is a GraphQL server with a scalable architecture that enables developers to build their APIs using a declarative approach. With microservices and new data being created faster than ever, data continues 
to be spread across multiple silos. Yet users and applications want one view of 
the data. Today, creating one view involves complex API creation and 
orchestration, forcing teams to spend time on development rather than value-added work. GraphQL is helping solve this problem. GraphQL is an emerging 
technology adopted by companies big and small, from innovative startups to 
Fortune 500 companies. With GraphQL, companies can iterate faster on APIs and 
application development by creating a unified GraphQL data layer for all their 
data. 

IBM API Connect Essentials was previously referred to as StepZen. You might still see references to StepZen in some of the enablement and overview material, but the product is the same.

![IBM APIC Essentials SaaS Post-Sales Journey](../images/apic-stepzen-journey.png)

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| APIC Essentials CSM | IBM APIC Essentials SaaS instance has been provisioned and the customer has access. | The client will be required to validate login by following the instructions at  <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/stepzen?topic=quickstart-install-set-up' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Install and Setup</a>. |

### Onboarded 

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| CSM | Customer has validated access to their APIC Essentials SaaS instance using their credentials, and built their GraphQL API. After the APIC Essentials SaaS instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the IBM SaaS console or the link in the provision request email. | After signing in, the customer can build GraphQL APIs by following the instructions from the <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/stepzen?topic=quickstart' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Quickstart page</a>.  CSM can also help guide customers by using some of the samples for the <a href='https://developer.ibm.com/components/api-connect/tutorials/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tutorials </a> page. |

### Deployed 

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |  
| CSM or Technology Expert Labs | The client is actively using their entitlement and is observing more than 10,000 API calls consistently for two consecutive months to be receiving value and considered "deployed". It is the responsibility of the CSM to guide the customer through the deployment phase, using Technology Expert Labs to make sure that the customer is seeing value from their purchase. | Learn from the demos available at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/c/StepZen' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Youtube </a> page. <br/><br/> **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:** TBD |

### Confirm Value & Expand 

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| CSM | Customer has realized value and is expanding usage to new business units. | Set up an <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/executive-business-review/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>EBR (executive business review)</a> with the client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen, and to confirm that the customer's strategic goals have been met. A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services and look for opportunities to expand the adoption with other business units. |

### Renewed 

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| CSM and/or Technical Sales |  The client has confirmed that they are using the product and will continue to renew their entitlement. |  N/A |
