## What is Instana and what does it do? <br/>
**IBM Observability by Instana** is an Enterprise Observability Platform powered by fully automated Application Performance Management. It ingests precise, one-second metrics, traces every request and profiles every process, correlates and analyzes the data so DevOps teams can optimize their application performance, especially microservices and cloud-native applications, and accelerate pipelines. The automated monitoring, comprehensive data model and powerful semantics, coupled with deep analytics, give stakeholders the actionable insights needed to keep services running at optimum levels.

## What are the pain points that Instana addresses?

"**Monitoring** tells you what is wrong, **observability** tells you why" <br/> <br/>
The key pain points that Instana addresses are related to the complexity of trying to resolve incidents in dynamic, modern environments. It complements the 1 second metric and full end-to-end transaction tracing that it gathers with rich AI-driven context that precisely identifies issues in seconds. <br/><br/>
Traditional monitoring tools provide less granular metrics, usually 10 seconds+ and sampled transaction traces.  That may be fine in static legacy environments but doesn’t work as well within the Cloud and micro-service/container/cloud-native applications where dependencies and service interconnections change rapidly.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Lack of end-to-end observability from mobile to the mainframe <br/>
Instana provides complete transaction path visibility without sampling. Sampling can cause significant delays in finding a problem source because access to critical issue information can be delayed or missed.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **IT teams are unable to rapidly detect and resolve issues in complex heterogeneous runtime technologies and target environments ranging from legacy systems of record to virtual machines to containers that could be distributed across multiple clouds <br/>
Transactions can experience issues anywhere along the path from the front-end initiator to the backend systems. Instana provides instant visibility into all of the transaction path services providing immediate visibility into any problems that occur.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to deliver reliable application response time to end users <br/>
Complex microservice architecture transactions are comprised of many small, containerized services. If a slowdown or malfunction in any of the transaction components or interconnects occurs, end-user application response time suffers. Instana provides complete information about full end-to-end transaction performance so that performance issues can be resolved or averted.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **IT teams spend too much time and energy on expensive monitoring tools that provide limited insight and are flooded with events and logs with no way to filter or eliminate noise <br/>
Instana provides precise insight with AI-driven context and alerts to enable teams to immediately find any issue and its dependencies. Instana Smart Alerts filter out the extraneous events and log noise to pinpoint where any issue is occurring.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to keep up with the rapid growth of cloud-native environments <br/>
Instana automation and ease of deployment are purpose-built for the rapid and continuously changing nature of cloud-native microservices applications.  It automatically discovers new microservices and container entities as they come online, without any additional instrumentation.<br/><br/>
**Key:** *Look for the pain that the IT teams are feeling with trying to run their hybrid environments that have outgrown their legacy monitoring tools.*<br/><br/>
The key here is that monitoring tells you what is wrong and observability tells you why. As businesses modernize, the complexity of the implementations increases beyond the capabilities of humans to be able to monitor them in a traditional, reactive way.<br/><br/>
Instana uses real-time insights and machine learning to find, alert and remediate production issues, identify bottlenecks and anomalies and filter noise reducing administrative overhead and improving "Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR).


## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Instana follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above along with the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC26J44RW4T6M84DmhG62hfT3PhB' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>AIOps Acceleration Workshop</a> or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://play-with.instana.io/#/home' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Click-through demo</a> has a script that can be used to quickly demonstrate the capabilities of Instana to the customer<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect Instana to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities to resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs can take ownership of an implementation project using their <a href='https://soda.dal1a.ciocloud.nonprod.intranet.ibm.com/show/3618' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>pre-packaged offerings.</a> CSM can help guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What personas might you engage when talking to a customer about APM?

**Engineering Leadership Buyer**: CIOs, CTOs, or VPs - responsible for aligning a company’s overall IT strategy and systems to support the company’s goals. <br/>
*Primary interest*: Release new application features rapidly and on time.<br/>
*Observability needs*: Business metrics to track customer satisfaction.<br/>
*Instana positioning*: Provides immediate business KPIs.<br/>

**DevOps Engineer**: Deliver reliable products that run well in production. Speed software delivery at a higher level of quality and with lower costs.<br/>
*Primary interest*: Processes, methodologies, and tools for software development life cycle enhancement.<br/>
*Observability needs*: CI/CD pipeline optimization.<br/>
*Instana differentiation*: Observe cloud, hybrid, and on-premises applications in pre-production and production.<br/>

**Developer**: Develops fresh code for new products, porting legacy apps to cloud-native, code fixes for maintenance, and code for business logic.<br/>
*Primary interest*: ensuring applications they develop can be deployed and run in production with no issues<br/>
*Observability needs*: Detailed and precise application code issue alerts.<br/>
*Instana differentiation*: Automatic profiling and end-to-end traces with context to enable instant triage.<br/>

**SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)**: Protect and progress the software and systems behind all services focusing on availability, performance, and capacity.<br/>
*Primary interest*: Achieve SLOs for application uptime, performance, and mean time to detect (MTTD) and remediate (MTTR)<br/>
*Observability needs*: 1) Early issue discovery 2) Reducing MTTR.<br/>
*Instana differentiation*: Service level objective (SLO) monitoring with automated discovery and context to reveal the root cause. Rapid MTTR.<br/>

## What do CSM-driven deployments look like?

Loblaws wanted to be able to monitor and alert on the performance of MQ, ACE, Liberty and DataPower running on OpenShift in IBM Cloud. The CSM worked with Technology Expert Labs, and IBM Consulting to deploy two Instana Server instances and OpenShift sensors in each OpenShift cluster as well as configure alerts and performance dashboards.

## Why would a customer deploy Instana if they already have an APM solution in-house?

Customers may have invested in an observability or application performance monitoring solution already, but there are additional benefits that Instana can provide. Here are some examples of where they should deploy Instana vs their existing APM solution

**Cloud native applications** - Use Instana for your new cloud native apps and continue using your existing APM solution for your legacy apps<br/>
Instana is the only cloud-native observability platform, designed to monitor highly dynamic and complex containerized, microservices-based applications <br/><br/>
With microservices, individual containers may spin up, do their work and disappear within a minute. High-resolution metric data provides as many data points as possible when this infrastructure is continually changing to make sure all issues are known. <br/><br/>
APM tools that were not designed for cloud-native are slower, provide incomplete traces, and lack the granularity to provide complete visibility.  Lower fidelity data results in blind spots and hinders issue diagnosis. <br/><br/>
Questions: <br/>
-Do you have any new projects or applications that leverage cloud native architectures and can benefit from purpose-built cloud observability solution<br/>
-Do your legacy tools understand new microservices applications?<br/>

**IBM technologies** – Use Instana to observe your IBM applications and workloads and keep using your legacy APM solution for everything else.<br/>
Instana provides better observability for the IBM software and services you own and will continue to be more tightly integrated over time. This is supported by the comprehensive range of recently added z/OS CICS and IMS middleware support.<br/><br/>
Generic APM tools cannot achieve the same level of integration and will only provide limited support<br/><br/>
Questions:<br/>
-What IBM applications or systems are you running?<br/>
-Instana supports a comprehensive range of IBM technologies, including  IBM Z, DB2, Datapower, MQ, ACE, API Connect, AIOps, OpenShift, WebSphere, APM, IBM Cloud just to name a few<br/>

**Mission-critical workloads** – Use Instana for your mission-critical apps that demand high performance and fast response times and keep your legacy APM on apps that can afford latency.<br/>
Instana collects & stores traces for 100% of application requests (no sampling), collecting metrics every second.<br/><br/>
Legacy APM tools that sample data can’t scale or handle the speed and volume resulting in longer times to detect, diagnose, and remediate or have blind spots that hinders issue remediation.<br/><br/>
Questions<br/>
-Do you experience any issues that seem like they take too long to resolve?<br/>
-Do you have service level agreements and are your meeting them?<br/>
-What are your MTTD, MMTR measurements and are you driving improvements to reduce them?<br/>

**Dynamic, interdependent systems** - Use Instana for dynamic, integrated systems that have interdependencies and keep your legacy APM on standalone single-purpose applications<br/>
Instana provides automatic, continuous discovery and real-time change detection and mapping of all interdependencies to ensure that you’re always looking at the latest, most accurate information.<br/><br/>
Legacy APM tools can’t keep up with dynamic environments and come with administrative overhead.  Different agents or plugins that have to be installed or configured for each technology create a level of complexity that burdens DevOps teams, consuming resources and slowing them down.<br/><br/>
Questions:<br/>
-Are you able to see everything that happens across your applications and infrastructure in real-time?<br/>
-Do changes in your applications, infrastructure and network topology require manual administration in your APM solution?<br/>


## How do I expand and grow Instana usage?

Instana is licensed by the number of <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCR8CfVqV6RX88fGmd4MX7WCHDX3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Managed Virtual Servers</a>. Expansion for Instana is as simple as adding more Virtual Servers to the Instana environment.
<br/>The proven Instana model is to land and expand by starting with a single application or line of business, proving value and then expanding to other applications and business units. The "value" of Instana is easily quantifiable by looking at the following:

  * Use AIOps to prevent issues (MTTP)
  * Reduction in MTTD and MTTR
  * Improved application response time and production availability
  * Improved deployment frequency

Quantifiable reductions and improvements are key to expansion. Collect as-is data points before deployment and 30, 60 and 90 days later compare the new results. The numbers will speak for themselves.



## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their modernization journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above. Be aware of the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCP6J3WQf9qdmG7M7Mp9DVXd3BVV' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>competition</a> and how to address the "we use Dynatrace", "we use AppDynamics" response.<br/><br/>
If you need to start from scratch with the overall "Automation" brand of products with your customer, then there is an <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/automation-innovation-workshop' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Automation Innovation Workshop</a> (free) that can be used when trying to generate interest, sponsors and use cases that is available to Sales teams and CSMs.<br/>
