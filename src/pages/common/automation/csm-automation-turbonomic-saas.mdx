**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

See below for detailed instructions on how to view the usage for your account.

## Overview
As a CSM, your focus is to guide and nurture your customers who have a Turbonomic SaaS entitlement.  Your job is to guide the customer with provisioning through to onboarding, help with their first use case (add a target, configure application discovery and grouping, take automated actions), and continue to expand their use cases.

You can learn more about Turbonomic on the <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/automation/csm-automation-turbonomic/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>playbook page</a>.

There are different paths for a customer to request a Turbonomic SaaS trial and/or paid instance (running in ROSA).  The client is required to create an <a href='https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBMid account</a>. |  **Provisioning the service:** <br/><br/> <Link to='/common/automation/csm-automation-turbonomic-saas-provision/#request-a-paid-instance-from-the-aws-marketplace'>Request a 30-day free trial instance from the AWS Marketplace</Link> <br/><br/> <Link to='/common/automation/csm-automation-turbonomic-saas-provision/#upgrade-from-a-trial-to-a-paid-instance-from-the-aws-marketplace'>Upgrade from a trial to a paid instance from the AWS Marketplace</Link><br/><br/> <Link to='/common/automation/csm-automation-turbonomic-saas-provision/#request-a-paid-instance-from-the-aws-marketplace'>Request a paid instance from the AWS Marketplace</Link> <br/><br/> <Link to='/common/automation/csm-automation-turbonomic-saas-provision/#how-to-request-a-paid-instance-if-my-customer-already-owns-a-turbonomic-saas-entitlement'>How to request a paid instance if my customer already owns a Turbonomic SaaS entitlement</Link> <br/><br/> **Nurture opportunities:**<br/> A <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/fvl5l58lz0ohyiws0w8adno4sa191osa" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Welcome Email Template</a> is available and can be used to introduce yourself to your client and provide links to the product documentation, how to raise a support ticket, how to join the Turbonomic Community and enablement material.

### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Turbonomic SRE and IBM CSM | Customer has validated access to their Turbonomic SaaS instance using their IBMid and added a target |  **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChm62RpdBFm3G2TdB7Bc9V339DB' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>**Plan Turbonomic**</a> <br/> IBM will review, validate, and understand during a remote discussion with customer.  A roadmap of adoption implementation recommendations based on customer priorities will be developed for further service opportunities. <br/><br/> **Getting started:** <br/> After the Turbonomic SaaS instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the AWS console (if provisioned from the AWS Marketplace) or from the email (if the request was submitted by an IBM Technical Seller). <br/> By default, the IAM for the instance is configured with IBM Verify and using IBMid.  A customer can configure the instance to use a different access management system but will need to work with support. <br/> The next step is to <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tarm/8.11.2?topic=started-configuring-targets' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>configure a target</a> and allow Turbonomic to discover entities. <br/><br/> **Nurture opportunities:**<br/> If no activity has been taken by the client, an <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/nil1v27b0pa4ngsc86syogm20iygqicu" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Onboarding Nudge Email Template</a> can be sent with instructions to add a target. <br/> After the onboarding process has been completed, an <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/3vk07v03zquu1i5yqa2c1dsc82dwfuei" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Onboarded Email Template</a> is available to advise the client to take the next step of their journey to take an action. |


### Deployed

| IBM CSM or Technology Expert Labs | The client has implemented actions that consume at least 10% of the purchased subscription capacity must be in use to be receiving value and considered deployed. | **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCTRBV4q6TTRR8TQ9bB9VPBb6WMB' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>**Build Turbonomic**</a><br/> Help Turbonomic clients create an architecture and deployment plan based on consultative discussions about what the client intends to achieve with the Turbonomic solution. <br/><br/> **Use the solution:** <br/> The image below captures the Turbonomic ARM Journey providing the customer with visibility of their on-prem, public Cloud and containerized environments, automated decisions that can be taken manually and ultimately, working towards allowing Turbonomic to take automated actions. You can learn more about Turbonomic on the <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/automation/csm-automation-turbonomic/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>playbook page</a>. <br/> The CSM is responsible for guiding the customer through the deployment phase, utilizing Technology Expert Labs to perform the configuration and testing required to get to automated actions being performed. <br/> <br/>  **Nurture opportunities:**<br/> When the client has successfully taken an action, a <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/hb6rj3uziesqus03vok5sxil34q65auk" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Deployed Email Template</a> can be sent to guide the customer on setting up automation in the environment. |
