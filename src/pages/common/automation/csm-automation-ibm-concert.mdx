What is the engagement model

CSM must engage the client from the very beginning to enable IBM to accelerate deployments.  Technology Expert Labs is engaged from the very beginning on IBM Concert with auto-attach of services.  Below is the engagement model as well as how the model should be executed. 

CSMs should be engaged prior to the sale.  This is a new product with a lot of focus and interest from IBM Corporate and Automation customers.  As a result of being new, it is not in current ELA catalogs so CSMs need to engage early to build reslationships.  CSMs need to be engaged as part of the POCs to understand what roadblocks exists so they can avoid them during deployment time.  

![Engagement Model](../images/ibm-concert-engagement-model.png)

## Deployment stages (Milestones)

Deployments are tracked in Gainsight through <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan'>Growth Plans</Link>. In ISC, these deployments are called Deployment Opportunities. These <Link to='/deploy/document-the-plan'>Deployment stages</Link> are called <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-milestones'>Milestones</Link> in Gainsight.

### Identify phase

#### Common practices

Before you start to work with the customer, you will need to learn about the customer, their industry, what was sold, and who you might work with.  Work with the seller and account team to understand if a sponsor(s) and use case(s) were identified.

| Practice | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <Link to='/onboard/understand-client-it-landscape/'>Learn about the customer</Link> | Before you get started, you need to learn about your customer and their business. |
| <Link to='/onboard/learn-partner/'>Learn about the partner</Link> | If your customer is working with a partner, you need to learn about the partner and their relationship with IBM and the customer. |
| <Link to='/onboard/understand-deal/'>Understand the deal</Link> | Learn where to find information related to how the product was sold to the customer. |
| <Link to='/deploy/identify/'>Identify</Link> | Understand what the customer will need to be successful. |

#### Product-specific practices

| Led by | Outcome | Assets & Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Prioritized use case | **If the customer has already done a PoC?** The CE team has already, through the workshop, identified use cases that customers might be interested in. The CSM should have a Transition meeting with the CE team. Before the meeting study all of the documents that were produced during the workshops to get a clear understanding of the use cases. <br/><br/> **If the customer has NOT done a POC?** Meet with the account ATL (Account Technical Leader) and BTS (Brand Technical Seller) to understand customer pain points around the solution and to get customer contacts.<br/> Reach out to those contacts through the ATL or Seller. Those contacts should include a manager of an application team. Begin to gather this information and propose a briefing and demo of IBM Concert. Through this exercise, you should be able to identify one or more use cases to pursue. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Find an application area and application owner who is prepared to begin the IBM Concert workshop. |  **If the customer has already done a PoX ?** <br/> - The CE team has probably identified, through the set of use cases, who the product owners are and the potential sponsors. As part of the Transition from CE, the CSM should familiarize themselves with key application owners and get introductions from the CE team if hasn’t already been done. <br/> - Work with the application owner to plan the Design and Architecture Workshop. Help them to identify the right people to engage in the workshop. This should be the application architects who have a depth of understanding of the application landscape. <br/><br/> **If the customer has NOT done a PoX or if this Application Owner was not involved in the PoX?** <br/> - Based on this individual’s knowledge of IBM Concert, you may need to perform another briefing a demo for this individual. <br/> - Work with the Application Owner to plan the Design and Architecture Workshop. Help them to identify the right people to engage in the workshop. This should be application architects who have a depth of understanding of the application landscape. <br/><br/> **After a sponsor is identified:**<br/> - Submit a request for the Workshop to Expert Labs through the <a href='https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7197619/Solution-Engineering-Request-Form' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request an Expert Labs Solution Engineer</a> form.<br/> - Work with the customer and Expert Lab to schedule the workshop<br/> - Be sure to brief Expert Labs regarding customer pain points and priorities.
