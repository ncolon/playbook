## What is Cloud Pak for AIOps and what does it do? <br/>
Enterprises want to better predict IT outages and resolve them more quickly. Cloud Pak for AIOps integrates with existing ChatOps platforms like Slack to provide insights directly where IT Operations teams work, and uses explainable AI to provide clear recommendations.  Cloud Pak for AIOps reveals new insights faster and offers them in a concise, engaging way that transforms user experiences and improves business outcomes.  Cloud Pak for AIOps uses explainable AI to help CIOs and IT Ops teams detect and diagnose complex issues by connecting the dots between structured and unstructured data in real time to give users a wholistic understanding of IT incidents.

## What are the pain points that Cloud Pak for AIOps addresses?

The shift to hybrid cloud architectures means a world with many independent services across environments, complexities which raise costs and increase operationalrisks for organizations. In addition, this broader transformation also means increases in data output from these systems, which in turn take weeks to sift through to effectively detect signals, and days to diagnose and fix issues.
IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps aims to address these complexities and provide an opportunity for IT Ops teams to tackle growing challenges around: <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Fragmented visibility into the health and performance of ITOps both within datacenters and across multi-cloud environments <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Excessive cost and complexity of ITOps due to the number of tools, skills, and processes required <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Risk exposure due to reactive support and slow identification and resolution of IT issues <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Static performance, resulting from the inability to harness predictive insights <br/><br/>
Cloud Pak for AIOps focuses on improving major incident management, reducing event noise, surfacing insights within existing ChatOps environments and automating provisioning. Most customers begin with reducing event noise and gradually add additional functionality over time.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?
See the description of the cohorts in the "there isn't a use case, where do I start?" section below.
**Sales Phase**: <br/>
*IBM Sales, IBM Tech Sales*: Close deal, identify sponsor, define success criteria <br/><br/>
*IBM Tech Sales, Client Engineering*: Perform PoX, gain agreement for Technology Expert Labs/Professional services <br/><br/>
**Deployment Phase**: <br/>
*IBM Technology Expert Labs*: Propose services and create DOU, execute DOU and deliver value to the customer <br/><br/>
*IBM CSM, IBM Tech Sales, IBM Technology Expert Labs*: identify areas for expansion and increased usage <br/><br/>


## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/rulbmymamyx2txrrxtsiophufzfskjk6.pptx' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>NCHC</a> is an example of an implementation of Cloud Pak for AIOps that created an intelligent maintenance and operation system based  to integrate structured or unstructured data provided by other network equipment monitoring software and problem ticket systems, perform machine learning and model training, and provide it to a front end that includes MatterMost, web management software portal, AIOps interface, etc. for management and monitoring.

## How do I expand and grow Cloud Pak for AIOps usage?
Start small with Event Management to show the benefits of event grouping and noise reduction and to then grow to into Metric Management and Log Anomaly Detection.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Identify your customer's cohort

### Cohort 1: Your customer is using one or more of the legacy Netcool products for Event Management.
Many Netcool entitlements have been “traded-up” to Cloud Pak for Watson AI Ops often without the customer knowing that new capabilities are available to them. The customers in this cohort can be engaged with a specific approach based on their existing use of Netcool for Event Management.<br/><br/>
1- For existing legacy Netcool Omnibus/Impact Event Management customers the first step in their journey is to help them <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCTCX76mPccVh8TXfF4Mdq9RfFFG'  target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> modernize to a Cloud Native Deployment running on OpenShift to become hybrid cloud ready and gain increased scalability</a>. This modernization is not just an architectural modernization, customers also get new “Cloud Native Event Analytics” functionality which Seasonal patterns and Temporal Event grouping. This is the first step in the journey that deliver the newer function with a modern architecture.<br/><br/>
2- IBM plans to continue to make incremental investments in this Cloud Native NOI code base to address market needs which reaffirms customers investment on NOI as the best-in-class event management solution.<br/><br/>
3- The customer is now ready augment their Event Management implementation with AI capabilities coming from AI manager such as Log Anomaly Detection, Change Risk, etc.  Review the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCE0cpX7IWjkeLUVbgRvJZPg'  target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>sales kit</a> for more information.

### Cohort 2: Your customer has objections to using OpenShift that are preventing their adoption of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps.

The newer capabilities of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps require OpenShift. The customers in this cohort have objections to OpenShift or a lack of understanding of OpenShift or containers that is preventing them considering the cloud native components of IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps.<br/>
Understand your customers objections to OpenShift. Consider that for Cloud Pak for Watson AI Ops, OpenShift is a vehicle to run our Cloud Native runtime in a tested, known, supported container runtime. In a hybrid cloud world, having more than one Kubernetes Cluster is expected and it is entirely likely that Cloud Pak for Watson AI Ops would live in its own, isolated cluster away from home-grown Cloud Native applications.<br/>
- For non-competitive situations (where the customer doesn’t have an alternative container solution), lead with the positioning OpenShift using the materials from the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/community-connections/red-hat-openshift-community/platform-positioning" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>CSM OpenShift Community</a>.<br/><br/>
- For competitive situations (where the customer either already has an alternative container solution or has a non-OpenShift direction) lead with the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/community-connections/red-hat-openshift-community/openshift-competitive" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>competitive materials from the CSM OpenShift Community</a>

### Cohort 3: Your customer has no existing use case for Cloud Pak for AIOps

Customers in this cohort have no existing IBM Event Management footprint and don’t have an identified use case for Cloud Pak for Watson AI Ops. They may be financial sales or they may be new customers that are just starting on their journey.<br/><br/>
Start with a AIOPS Journey Workshop run Technology Expert Labs that lays out a AIOPS adoption journey. In most cases the journey starts with Event Manager. Start small with Event Management to show the benefits of event grouping and noise reduction and to then grow to into Metric Management and Log Anomaly Detection.<br/>
Making the first steps with customers in this cohort can be a challenge so the approach is to generate interest using the AIOps Acceleration Workshop from Technology Expert Labs which will look at the current landscape and recommend an approach to modernize. This is <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cloud-and-cognitive-expert-labs/ask-an-expert/leadership-blog/4da69720-ba52-11eb-a38d-35873299d570" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>a “free” investment workshop</a>.
