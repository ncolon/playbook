## What is IBM Websphere Hybrid Edition and what does it do? <br/>
IBM WebSphere Hybrid Edition helps you optimize WebSphere applications today, with flexible licensing and deployment options for immediate cost savings, while planning to modernize them now or later. It contains entitlements to <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSBS6K_3.2.1/featured_applications/was_nd.html' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment</a>, <a href='https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-server' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>WebSphere Application Server</a>, <a href='https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> WebSphere Liberty</a>, and <a href='https://www.ibm.com/cloud/mono2micro' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Mono2Micro</a>.

## What are the pain points that IBM Websphere Hybrid Edition addresses?

The key pain points that WebSphere Hybrid Edition addresses are related to the modernization, cost reduction and flexibility, such as: <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Need to optimize applications and operations to lower costs and increase flexibility <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Desire to modernize applications while utlizing existing investments <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Need to cloud enable a legacy IT estate with enhanced operations and AI-infused guidance and automation <br/><br/>
WebSphere Hybrid edition allows customers to switch between WebSphere editions without license changes and to automate the modernization of existing applications to the  modern, cloud-ready Liberty runtime using Transformation Advisor and Mono2Micro

Refer to the <Link to='/common/modernization/modernization-was'>WebSphere Modernization Play</Link> for more information on modernizing WebSphere.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

The majority of customers that have purchased WebSphere Hybrid Edition already have some kind of WebSphere deployment and have acquired WebSphere Hybrid Edition as a vehicle to help them modernize. The objective in these situations is to assist the customer in modernizing their WebSphere ND environments to Liberty and, if they are interested in containerization, modernize to Libery on OpenShift.

Work with the account team to understand the current WebSphere footprint and modernization plans. If the customer is unfamiliar with the modernization approach, use the <a href='https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/modernization-playbook/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Modernization Playbook</a> and <a href='https://github.ibm.com/garage-tsa/AppMod_WiaB' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>CSM WAS Modernization Workshop</a> to show them the benefits of Liberty and containerization. Be sure to educate yourself on how to use Transformation Advisor with your customers using the CSM specific <a href='https://ibm.box.com/v/TAforTechSales' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Presentation</a> and <a href='https://ibm.box.com/v/TAforTechSalesRecording' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Recording</a>

Client Engineering can help demonstrate the modernization journey to the customer and Technology Expert Labs and our Business Partners can put modernization practices in place to modernize applications at scale.

Refer to the <Link to='/common/modernization/modernization-was'>WebSphere Modernization Play</Link> for more information on modernizing WebSphere.

## Who is responsible for what, when?
**Sales Phase**: <br/>
*IBM Sales, IBM Tech Sales*: Close deal, identify sponsor, define success criteria <br/><br/>
*IBM Tech Sales, Client Engineering*: Perform PoX, gain agreement for Technology Expert Labs/Professional services <br/><br/>
**Deployment Phase**: <br/>
*IBM Technology Expert Labs*: Propose services and create DOU, execute DOU and deliver value to the customer <br/><br/>
*IBM CSM, IBM Tech Sales, IBM Technology Expert Labs*: identify areas for expansion and increased usage <br/><br/>


## What do CSM-driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/3v3agcltwl09yugw44m958dfdcyaglcs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Asian Paints</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement where the CSM (Prageetika Sharma) and Technology Expert Labs worked together to modernize existing WebSphere ND applications to Liberty on OpenShift.

## How do I expand and grow IBM Websphere Hybrid Edition usage?

Most customers are reducing their WebSphere usage, not increasing it. In some situations customers may be still writing new applications in Java and are interested in using the Liberty runtime and this is where expansion can occur. As applications become smaller and more numerous, it is possible that the Liberty usage will increase over time. Showing the benefits of <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmafFvNiPlU6zmZRK5B2U3g' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Liberty</a>  for new, microservices-like development is key here.


## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

It is unlikely a customer has purchased WebSphere Hybrid Edition if they don't already have WebSphere Application Server. The key is to understand why the purchase was made:

  * Business as usual: The customer has no intention to modernize
  * Operational driven modernization: The operations team that administers the WebSphere environment wants to move to Liberty/containers
  * Business driven modernization: The business wants to become more agile and move towards microservices

**Customer facing case studies?**

Case Study showing how <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/3v3agcltwl09yugw44m958dfdcyaglcs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Asian Paints</a> modernized from WebSphere ND. IBM Technology Expert Labs embarked on a significant AppMod journey with Asian Paints in transforming their existing WebSphere applications to Red Hat OpenShift with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. Besides migration to Liberty containers, Expert Labs had closely worked with Asian Paints in integrating their existing DevOps investments and demonstrating key cloud capabilities like AutoScaling, HealthChecks, Logging and Monitoring Dashboards on OpenShift.
There are many other case studies in the <a href='https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Use Case Repository (deprecated)</a> and in the new <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STARS repository.</a>
