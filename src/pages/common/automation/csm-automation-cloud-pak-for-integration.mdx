## What is IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and what does it do?

**IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration** offers a single, unified platform for all enterprise integration needs. It deploys integration capabilities into the Red Hat® OpenShift® managed container environment. IBM Cloud Pak for Integration uses the monitoring, logging, and security systems of Red Hat OpenShift to ensure consistency across all integration solutions. 


## What pain points does IBM Cloud Pak for Integration address?
To support our customers digital transformation initiatives, we need to implement the right integration technologies as architectural needs evolve. **Cloud Pak for Integration** is IBM's Hybrid Integration Platform that helps to solve:<br/><br/>
**Drive new engagement models and digital transformation**<br/>
  Promoting tailored offers at point of sale, based on past purchases<br/>
  Providing an omni-channel client experience<br/>
  Delivering a holistic ’360’ view of your customers<br/><br/>
**Accelerate integration while reducing costs** <br/>
  Empowering agile teams to build and deploy their own integrations <br/>
  Replacing the bottleneck of a centralized, monolithic architecture <br/>
  Removing the inefficiency and cost of maintaining multiple integration offerings <br/><br/>
**Reduce exposure to business and security risks** <br/>
  Updating systems of record with integrity and at scale <br/>
  Keeping your reputation intact by protecting business data and client records <br/>
  Ensuring that back-end systems can manage workloads without costly and disruptive changes or scaling <br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?
<a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/h1qk339v5r3qdnkrj76be9gxiiqc8w9m' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>ICICI Bank</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Gautam Bhat) and Technology Expert Labs worked together to migrate ICICI's API Connect point product deployment to **Cloud Pak for Integration**

## The steps to deploy. Who is responsible for what, when?
Most of the customers that have puchased Cloud Pak for Integration already have some of our Integration capabilities (e.g. ACE/MQ/APIC/Datapower) deployed as point products.  They might have traded up to the Cloud Pak of Integration license to take advantage of the flexible licensing and want to continue running as-is or they might want to modernize. If they are interested in modernization, you should help them with migration to Cloud Pak for Integration on OpenShift.

Work with the account team to understand the current Integration footprint and modernization plans. If the customer is unfamiliar with the modernization approach, use an <a href='http://ibm.biz/aia-internal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>agile integration workshop</a> to understand where they are on their integration journey. The artifacts available at <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/asset-modernization/#' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Cloud Pak Modernization Guide</a>, specific to Integration should also help.

Client Engineering can help demonstrate the modernization journey to the customer by creating a POV. Technology Expert Labs and our Business Partners can put modernization practices in place to modernize applications at scale.

You can also follow the traditional model of : <br/><br/>
**Identify a pain point, sponsor, and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)** Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmmX8bCDfqHDG7CMfWW3G6Gb7R8" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Cloud Paks</a>.  This client facing deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the pak and what is available standalone.<br/><br/>
**Prove value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, IBM Cloud Pak for Integration TAM and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities that resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs can take ownership of an implementation project using their pre-packaged offerings. The TAM and CSM can help guide the customer through the implementation project.

## How do I expand and grow IBM Cloud Pak for Integration usage?
Start by showing the customer the value of modernization by getting them to move one or two of their key workloads like App Connect or MQ based applications to Cloud Pak for Integration.  As part of that migration, look for opportunities as to how an API led strategy can benefit them or maybe events might sense in some places.  Use the following conversation starters:
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCHgQBQHPMGVR84VmgFdDR86R7WG' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Messaging and connectivity</a>
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC8GR4D7MjQGc8TBXbXTVPWV3MXG' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>API-led Integration</a>
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCWWDW6gFpXW6GTQp7G7P3p46g2d' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Event-led Integration</a>
* <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCgVcqWGDDVHm84T2DqXQfXqWdgB" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Deal Expansion with Cloud Paks</a>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

A good place to start would be to collaborate with the Client Engineering team to propose an <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/skol/ce-int-guild/accelerators/aiw/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' > Automation Innovation Workshop(AIW). </a>  Your customer will discover how they can improve their business results using the power of Automation, and receive a personalized consultation, based on their unique needs and challenges. <br/><br/>
Many existing customers, who have products from our Integration portfolio have been "traded-up" to Cloud Pak for Integration often without the customer knowing that new capabilities are available to them. An <a href='http://ibm.biz/aia-internal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' > Integration Modernization Workshop</a> might be a good option to get them to start thinking about modernizing their workloads. <br/><br/>
Your customer has objections to using OpenShift that are preventing their adoption of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. Some of the newer capabilities of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration require OpenShift. The customers in this category have objections to OpenShift or a lack of understanding of OpenShift or containers that is preventing them considering the cloud native components of IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.
Understand your customers objections to OpenShift. Consider that for Cloud Pak for Integration, OpenShift is a vehicle to run our Cloud Native runtime in a tested, known, supported container runtime. In a hybrid cloud world, having more than one Kubernetes Cluster is expected and it is entirely likely that Cloud Pak for Integration would live in its own, isolated cluster away from home-grown Cloud Native applications. <br/><br/>
For customers, who have objections to OpenShift because of the large initial footprint required to get started, you can now run Cloud Pak for Integration on a Single Node OpenShift Cluster(SNO). Rashid Atallah R Aljohani(rashid.aljohani@ibm.com) has created a demo of running Cloud Pak for Integration on a SNO cluster.  You can view the demo at <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/wf9nqvpul3lnkwmbt5721oj5zq6lihfr">SNO-CP4I Demo</a>

For non-competitive situations (where the customer doesn’t have an alternative container solution), lead with the positioning OpenShift using the materials from the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/community-connections/red-hat-openshift-community/platform-positioning' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' >CSM OpenShift Community. </a> <br/><br/>
For competitive situations (where the customer either already has an alternative container solution or has a non-OpenShift direction) lead with the <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/community-connections/red-hat-openshift-community/openshift-competitive" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>competitive materials from the CSM OpenShift Community</a> <br/>

### API lifecycle management

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title="API lifecycle management">

This capability provided using **API Connect** lets you securely manage the lifecycle of your APIs across multicloud deployments and multiple environments.

**Practice Leader Comments:**  This is implemented using IBM API Connect and we are still seeing many customers exposing APIs for the first time.  You might also see several customers deploying this as a point product.  One of the other key use cases at the moment is APIC upgrade from V5(going out of service)/V2018 to APIC V10.  For guidance related upgrades, visit <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/api-connect-upgrade-central-getting-started" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>APIC Upgrade Central</a>.

### Application integration

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title="Application integration">

This capability lets you build integration flows quickly using a catalog of pre-built connectors and templates.

**Practice Leader Comments:**  This capability is also known as **IBM App Connect Enterprise**. **AppConnect** offers enterprise service bus (ESB) and agile integration architecture (AIA) microservices deployment of integration artifacts. You might also hear customers mention the name **IBM Integration Bus**, which is approaching end of support. You can build AppConnect flows thru two ways.  AppConnect Designer, which is available thru the Cloud Pak for Integration AppConnect Dashboard and is meant to build integrations quickly using a low code or zero code approach using pre-built connectors, which are part of the catalog.   A second way is using the feature rich AppConnect Enterprise toolkit, which can be used for building flows which require more complex transformations.  You will see this most at customers, who already are using IBM Integration Bus or AppConnect Enterprise.
