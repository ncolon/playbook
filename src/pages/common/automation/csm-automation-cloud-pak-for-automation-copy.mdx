## What pain points does IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation address?

The key pain points that IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation addresses are related to starting and scaling digital initiatives to meet increased business performance. <br/>

**Business data is inaccessible and siloed**  Business data is either hidden in manual documents, multiple systems, or not in the correct formats for easy actionability. For example, product usage data for clients that sit in multiple systems can’t be easily pulled into one view – making it difficult to effectively cross-sell opportunities at the right point in time. Or, a new regulation comes that requires a different approach to managing personal identification information (PII), Clients are not able to track down all the places that PII lives in their systems – putting their business at risk for hefty fines, or worse. <br/><br/>
**Performance gaps caused by manual systems prevent efficiency**  For example, customer service reps who have to manually enter data into multiple systems to approve applications experience delays to customers and are prone to errors. Without the ability to track key metrics across the company, it’s difficult to pinpoint where those companies should focus their attention first to have the greatest impact on operations as a whole. <br/><br/>
**Execution on key initiatives is slowed**  Execution on key initiatives, particularly the ability for line of business (LOBs) to quickly respond to changing demands, is slowed because they don’t have the right tools available that they can use to quickly make changes themselves. The LOB must rely on shared IT resources or outsourced resources with projects that take several cycles because of unclear requirements due to a lack of subject matter expertise (SME) involvement in the process. <br/><br/>

### Identify phase

#### Common practices

Before you start to work with the customer, you will need to learn about the customer, their industry, what was sold, and who you might work with.

| Practice | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <Link to='/onboard/understand-client-it-landscape/'>Learn about the customer</Link> | Before you get started, you need to learn about your customer and their business. |
| <Link to='/onboard/learn-partner/'>Learn about the partner</Link> | If your customer is working with a partner, you need to learn about the partner and their relationship with IBM and the customer. |
| <Link to='/onboard/understand-deal/'>Understand the deal</Link> | Learn where to find information related to how the product was sold to the customer. |
| <Link to='/deploy/identify/'>Identify</Link> | Understand what the customer will need to be successful. |

You will need to understand if the customer is an existing DataStage customer who needs to focus on modernization or if this is new to CP4BA.

<Tab label='Process-mining Acceleration'>

## Scope

Process mining is a technique that applies AI to discover, monitor, and optimize business processes by analyzing available knowledge from event log systems and desktop interactions. IBM Process Mining enables organizations to identify the business processes that might benefit most from automation by using business system data to create and visualize an end-to-end process to uncover derivations, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies that are hidden in business processes.

This accelerator focuses on clients who haven’t deployed yet or want to discover and automate further. It also helps existing Business Automation clients to extend their Could Pak for Business Automation footprint.


## End-to-end Process Mining journey

- Strategize with ATL/tech sales at the account and involve the Client Engineering team
- Leverage the IBM Hypersonic Pattern: <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://process-mining.tech-patterns.techzone.ibm.com">Process Mining Technology Pattern</a>
- Engage Technology Expert Labs: <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGC9F9CRPMX484PCHjQ4HFbmfXd">Process Mining Quickstart - Intelligent Process Analysis & Discovery</a> (if you don’t know your Technology Expert Labs Seller they <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://clientresourcelocator.wdc1a.cirrus.ibm.com/">can be found here</a>)

<Tab label='FileNet Modernization'>

## Scope
IBM FileNet Content Manager modernization is the process of taking customers running workloads on traditional point products and moving them to FileNet Content Manager running as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation on OpenShift. 
Most clients traditionally running FileNet as a point product will have resistance to change to a new form factor. Most enterprises have been running mission-critical workloads for a long time and are quite happy with the way things are running. You will face this challenge not just with FileNet but with any capability in the Business Automation portfolio. Hence the discussions should be moved away from a Middleware vs. Platform discussion to more of a discussion around the current pain points of the customer.

-	ONLY targeting the clients who have done CP4BA license trade-up, AND
-	Currently using CP4BA licenses for FileNet standalone deployments

If the client’s deployments still using one or more following standalone licenses (inside or outside catalog). It will be BA sales and tech sales trade-up conversation. 
- IBM FileNet Content Manager
- IBM Records Manager
- IBM Case Foundation
- IBM Content Foundation
- IBM Image Services
- IBM Content Manager
- IBM Case Manager

You can learn more about FileNet in <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC3JJb28G6b4m8TGqRJ3hP87ccDd">Seismic</a>.

**Why should a customer modernize?**

Deploying products in a container environment can be faster and easier than a standard on-premises installation. Additionally, updating software in a container environment can be simpler and less disruptive. 
If the client has the following requirements for the content services environment, container deployment is a good option:
-	Dynamic scalability to adjust to workload
-	Zero downtime support for patching
-	Ability to not only quickly patch or upgrade but quickly rollback to previous versions
-	Better resource usage and management
-	Better resiliency for your applications

In addition, the client gets more from CP4BA than what they could get in a stand-alone implementation of FileNet,
-	Orchestrate and automate all types of business processes
-	Gain enterprise-grade container security and simplified administration 
-	Automatically classify and enrich document metadata
-	Gain low-code app development tooling for citizen developers
-	Auto-collect, archive and govern sensitive or regulated content
-	Monitor content actions in real-time using dashboards

For client-facing material, see the Compelling Reason to Act in the **Engage Client Phase** section goes into more depth on the advantages of moving to CP4BA.

**How complex is a modernization?**
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. In most cases, Technology Expert Labs modernization engagement is needed. TEL will conduct an Assessment to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan. 
In summary, assets can be modernized from FileNet Standalone to Cloud Pak for Business Automation. IBM has confidence that FileNet on Cloud Pak for Business Automation is ready for most customers. However, in some situations, there are <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6620801">known limitations.</a>

<Tab label='Workflow Modernization'>

## Scope
IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) modernization is the process of taking customers running workloads on traditional point products and moving them to Business Automation Workflow (BAW) running as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation on OpenShift. 

Most clients traditionally running BPM as a point product will have resistance to change to a new form factor. Most enterprises have been running mission-critical workloads for a long time and are quite happy with the way things are running. You will face this challenge not just with BPM but with any capability in the Business Automation portfolio. Hence the discussions should be moved away from a Middleware Vs. Platform discussion to more of a discussion around the current pain points of the customer.

In 2018, BPM and IBM Case Manager (ICM) combined to create BAW, a key capability of IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation. This single offering empowers companies to automate a variety of workflow patterns, from straight-through processing (STP), to ad-hoc, to advanced case management, and everything in between. It is important to emphasize that BAW is built on the same foundation as BPM and ICM so existing case and process solutions can remain as-is, with no need to re-write applications or migrate code from the latest versions.

You can learn more about BAW in <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCRFm2Cjhb3gHGcWJcjcFD7QD84P#/?anchorId=c79a7260-a948-4f57-8410-8cdd85a99a45">Seismic</a>.

For client-facing material, see the Compelling Reason to Act in the **Engage Client Phase** section goes into more depth on the advantages of moving to CP4BA.

**How complex is a modernization?**
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. The purpose of the Technology Expert Labs Assessment is to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan. You can find a graphical view of the modernization and an example path from Technology Expert Labs starting on slide 13 of the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/w7fhf89f86ergf5wab1zf6ey0a51zxai">Workflow Modernization POV Deck</a>

In summary, assets can be modernized from BPM Standalone to BAW on Cloud Pak for Business Automation. IBM has confidence that BAW on Cloud Pak for Business Automation is ready for customers to modernize from BPM and that a repeatable process exists with our Workflow Modernization Journey.

### Details

### Pain points in the as-is process
The end user is feeling frustrated with the automated bot responses as they don't fully meet their intended purpose, despite being automated.

![As is frustration](../images/as-is-frustration.png)

#### Discovering the as-is process
First, we need to understand the pain points by discovering the as-is process, identifying the bottlenecks, and seeing the impact of process re-engineering on the overall cost and time using IBM Process Mining.

In our MVP, IBM Process Mining serves as a powerful tool to discover, analyze, and identify areas of improvement in the business process. We uploaded the process data, and IBM Process Mining created an end-to-end view of the ticketing process including all the activities and paths.

We have used process mining to visualize the process activities and paths, and from this visualization, we started analyzing the discovered process. We checked the various process paths taken to complete each request. The conformance option helped us to see how the ticketing process behaves versus the expected process. This gave us insights into the process deviations and if there were any unnecessary activities.

The Model view is supported in analyzing the performance of the process. Time and cost are always the primary dimensions to consider the process performance. The Model view showed the activity's duration and cost in a very simple way. The activities are colored and if the activity is darker color this means it takes more time or higher cost depending on the dimension chosen. KPIs measurement was applied for the activities to provide us insights into whether the actual duration is meeting the expectations.

The tool effectively highlighted bottlenecks and pain points. Furthermore, through simulation and testing, we pinpointed specific areas for improvement in the process aiming to reduce both duration and cost. 

We have discovered that those four main tasks can be automated aiming to reduce both duration and cost. 

1. The `Receive and Classify` Task can be automated to help classify the tickets and direct them to the proper team. 
2. The `Select offer and send response` task can be automated to generate a suitable offer and an automated response to the customer. 
3. The `Determine Customer offers` task can be automated to have a consistent and reliable decision based on the business direction.  
4. `Tickets resolution` takes considerable time and need to find a way to increase the team productivity.

We have used the “What-if” analysis to simulate future processes to build concrete improvement recommendations showing the time and cost savings.

![IBM Process Mining](../images/ibm-process-mining.png)

#### Process Re-Engineering
Based on the recommendations from the first step, we need to perform process re-engineering using IBM BAW.

In the MVP,  we have used IBM Business Automation Workflow to perform process re-engineering based on the recommendations shared from IBM Process Mining. This includes designing, managing and executing end-to-end the ”To-be” process workflow that automates human and system processes.

BAW provides the following benefits:

1. Process Efficiency and Automation
2. Increase employee productivity
3. Drive down costs
4. Deliver customized and automated client experiences at scale

For this MVP, CP4BA (BAW) is installed on Red Hat OpenShift, and the process is designed and implemented at BAW as per the below screenshot. Process Mining identified that some tasks require automation to streamline the process. As you can see the second lane includes all the tasks that are completely automated and doesn’t require any user intervention. These tasks have been automated using watsonx and IBM Automation. Additionally, the ticket resolutions are supported with IBM AIOps.

Additionally, using IBM BAW allows easy customization for the UI for creating personalized MVPs to each client.

![BAW Process](../images/baw-process.png)

#### Client Journey
The below diagram explains the client journey in the revamped process.

1. The client submits the ticket
2. watsonx classifies the ticket to the respective team, and BAW auto-routes the ticket accordingly.
3. The OSS/BSS team investigates and resolves the ticket with full observability and resource management utilizing IBM Instana and IBM Turbonomic.
4. The business authored the business rules related to the retention offers on IBM Operational Decision Manager.
5. This feature is not yet implemented, and a future enhancement idea to extract the data from the social media feed to understand the general user sentiment about the company using watsonx.
6. watsonx.ai takes all the input from the ticket itself, the resolution response, and the retention offers from ODM, and generated customized user feedback.
7. The client receives a response to their ticket timely.

![Client Journey](../images/client-journey.png)

### Submit Ticket
The initial step in the client journey is for the client to submit the issue or concern through an intuitive user interface on either a mobile device or a web portal. The UI is implemented as a coach on IBM BAW.

![BAW Submit Ticket](../images/baw-submit-ticket.png)

#### Streamline Classification with watsonx for Efficient Categorization
Using watsonx.ai model `flan-ul2 from Hugging Face library` to categorize the tickets automatically to the respective team, in this case to OSS (Operational Support System) or BSS (Business Support System) based on the ticket data.

Flan-ul2 is a 20 billion encoder/decoder which is efficient in classification. Different models are optimized for different tasks, and watsonx.ai provides the freedom to choose the best model fit for the different use cases. In this use case, this model is chosen to understand the concern/ticket as the input might be big depending on the concern, and the output is a classification class which is the intended team.

The MVP instructed the model through prompt engineering with a few shots prompting on what’s the scope for each team. Additionally, Greedy has been selected as a model parameter to allow the model to select the word/token with the highest probability.

#### Ticket Resolution empowered by IBM Instana and IBM Turbonomic
You will notice below that the ticket is automatically classified by watsonx as OSS-related. The OSS team shall use Instana for full observability around the case, and Turbonomic to assure application performance continuously.

The MVP integrated the OpenShift environment with Instana and integrated Instana with Turbonomic.

![BAW Case Resolution](../images/baw-case-resolution.png)

#### Empower Business Decision-Making with IBM Operational Decision Manager
ODM has been used to empower business users with their decisions on retention offers.

For this MVP, CP4BA (ODM) is installed on Red Hat OpenShift, and provides the following benefits to the business: 

1. Centralized repo for all the business rules (source for the decisions across all the systems instead of having it scattered across).
2. Business language that can be clearly understood by the business so that the business users can author directly the business rules.
3. Built-in governance framework for release management including collaboration between the different stakeholders to agree on decisions and activities for production adoption.
4. Out-of-the-box testing and simulation activities for the business users through business scenarios with native reports, allowing the business to measure the impact of future decisions with different what-if scenarios.
5. Quick time to market for any new business initiative that requires a change of decision without updating the different systems.

The below screenshot is from the ODM Decision Center, showing how easy it is for business users to author their business decisions.
![ODM](../images/odm.png)

#### Harnessing watsonx for Dynamic Responses with Governance
watsonx.ai took all the input from the ticket itself, the resolution response, and the retention offers from ODM, and generated customized user feedback – which can be reviewed and edited by the client representative. 

The model used is Granite, which is an IBM-built decoder-only model. It is trained on 7TB of data generating 13 billion parameters utilizing data from the Internet, Academic, Code, Legal, and Finance. At 13 billion parameters, the Granite models are more efficient than larger models, fitting onto a single GPU.  

Every dataset that is used in training undergoes a defined governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) review process. IBM has developed governance procedures for incorporating data into the IBM Data Pile which are consistent with IBM AI Ethics principles.

Much media attention has (rightly) been focused on the risk of generative AI producing hateful or defamatory output. IBM knows that businesses can’t afford to take such risks, so the granite models are trained on data scrutinized by the “HAP - Hate, Abuse and Profanity detector,” a language model trained by IBM to detect and root out hateful and profane content (hence “HAP”), which is benchmarked against internal as well as public models. After a score is assigned to each sentence in a document, analytics are run over the sentences and scores to explore the distribution, which determines the percentage of sentences for filtering. Besides this, there is a wide range of other quality measures. For example, searching for and removing duplication that improves the quality of output and using document quality filters to further remove low-quality documents not suitable for training. These granite models were trained with 7TB of data (pre-processing) and ended up with 2.4TB of data after processing.

Model parameters:
- Zero-shot prompting: no sample emails are given to the model. Based on the client's need, a few shots can be also adopted.
- Temperature 0.7, in general, the higher the temperature the higher the randomness. Setting the temperature to 0 means the model will always return the same result. This allows the model for creativity. This parameter can be adjusted easily based on the client's use case.
