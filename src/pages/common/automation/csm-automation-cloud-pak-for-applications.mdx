## What is Cloud Pak for Applications and what does it do? <br/>
Cloud Pak for Applications is a bundle of the following:

  - Unrestricted entitlement to Red Hat OpenShift (customers can deploy any workloads to a cluster with this entitlement, which is different to the other Cloud Paks which are restricted to only deploying workloads provided by the Cloud Pak) <br/>
  - PVCs of WebSphere (ND, Base, Liberty) that can be deployed on traditional environments like VMs OR in containers <br/>
  - <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/4394291"  target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Red Hat Runtimes</a><br/>
  - Transformation Advisor

Previous (now "End of Service") versions of Cloud Pak for Applications included the following products which are no longer part of Cloud Pak for Applications v5.1

  - PVCs of MobileFirst that can be deployed on traditional environments like VMs OR in containers <br/>
  - Accelerators for Teams and AppNav

## What are the pain points that Cloud Pak for Applications addresses?

The key pain points that Cloud Pak for Applications addresses are related to the modernization, cost reduction and flexibility, such as: <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Need to optimize applications and operations to lower costs and increase flexibility <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Desire to modernize applications while utlizing existing investments <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Need to run unrestricted Red Hat OpenShift <br/><br/>

Refer to the <Link to='/common/modernization/modernization-was'>WebSphere Modernization Play</Link> for more information on modernizing WebSphere.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Customers that purchased Cloud Pak for Applications fall in to two main categories:

1) Customers that have purchased Cloud Pak for Applications that already have some kind of WebSphere deployment and either want to continuing running WebSphere as-is or want to modernize. The objective in these situations is to assist the customer modernize their WebSphere ND environments to Liberty and, if they are interested in containerization, modernize to Libery on OpenShift.<br/>
Work with the account team to understand the current WebSphere footprint and modernization plans. Refer to the <Link to='/common/modernization/modernization-was'>WebSphere Modernization Play</Link> for more information on modernizing WebSphere.<br/>
Client Engineering can help demonstrate the modernization journey to the customer and Technology Expert Labs and our Business Partners can put modernization practices in place to modernize applications at scale.<br/><br/>
2) Customers that have purchased Cloud Pak for Applications for unrestricted OpenShift entitlements. In this case you should use a deployment partner such as Technology Expert Labs or Red Hat themselves to install a production ready OpenShift Cluster


## Who is responsible for what, when?

**Sales Phase**: <br/>
*IBM Sales, IBM Tech Sales*: Close deal, identify sponsor, define success criteria <br/><br/>
*IBM Tech Sales, Client Engineering*: Perform PoX, gain agreement for Technology Expert Labs/Professional services <br/><br/>
**Deployment Phase**: <br/>
*IBM Technology Expert Labs*: Propose services and create DOU, execute DOU and deliver value to the customer <br/><br/>
*IBM CSM, IBM Tech Sales, IBM Technology Expert Labs*: identify areas for expansion and increased usage <br/><br/>


## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/3v3agcltwl09yugw44m958dfdcyaglcs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Asian Paints</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement where the CSM (Prageetika Sharma) and Technology Expert Labs worked together to modernize existing WebSphere ND applications to Liberty on OpenShift.

## How do I expand and grow Cloud Pak for Applications usage?

If your customer has entitlements that they aren't fully utilizing then look to expand the unrestricted OpenShift footprint.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Case Study showing how <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/3v3agcltwl09yugw44m958dfdcyaglcs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Asian Paints</a> modernized from WebSphere ND. IBM Technology Expert Labs embarked on a significant AppMod journey with Asian Paints in transforming their existing WebSphere applications to Red Hat OpenShift with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. Besides migration to Liberty containers, Expert Labs had closely worked with Asian Paints in integrating their existing DevOps investments and demonstrating key cloud capabilities like AutoScaling, HealthChecks, Logging and Monitoring Dashboards on OpenShift.
