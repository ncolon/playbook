## What is Turbonomic ARM and what does it do?

Turbonomic AI-Powered Application Resource Management (ARM) **automatically assures applications get the resources they need to perform**, no matter where they run or how they are architected. Turbonomic continuously and automatically assures performance by eliminating resource congestion at every layer of the application stack, from the business application to the underlying hybrid and multicloud environment.

## What are the pain points that Turbonomic ARM addresses?

The key pain points that Turbonomic addresses are related to the complexity of correctly and continuously ensuring that an application has the resources it needs to perform reliably, such as: <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to deliver reliable application response time to end users <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Over-provisioning to ensure application performance <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **IT teams spend too much time and energy on expensive monitoring tools that provide limited insight <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **IT teams rely on human oversight to make resourcing decisions <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Lack visibility into the resources that micro-services and containers are using <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Working in siloed teams <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to keep up with the rapid growth of cloud-native environments <br/><br/>
Turbonomic is often thought of as a "right-sizing" tool that can be used to reduce cloud spend. While this may be a side-effect of continuously ensuring that an application has the resources it needs to perform, it is not a leading use case or message that we use with customers. **Focus on "continuously ensuring that an application has the resources it needs to perform reliably" which results in "stickiness" instead of Turbonomic being used once to cut costs and not continually.**

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Turbonomic is unique in that most customers that have VMWare or run any applications on a hyperscaler such as AWS or Azure can benefit from **automatically assuring that applications get the resources they need to perform**. <br/><br/>
If you need to start from scratch with the overall "Automation" brand of products with your customer, then there is an <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/automation-innovation-workshop' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Automation Innovation Workshop</a> (free) that can be used when trying to generate interest, sponsors and use cases that is available to Sales teams and CSMs. <br/><br/>
Using the list of pain points above, look for applications and lines of business that struggle with assuring performance or correctly sizing their resources and lead with the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/app?ContentId=cc14ec33-2c68-4c63-9a4b-6f197edde734#/doccenter/f6bc8873-d580-4ee8-a903-c4e0d3a7eee9/doc/%252Fdd85c941b1-5f54-2314-ce72-b98c4c0974c2%252FdfOTRiYmU4NTQtNWY4NC03Y2QyLWZjYWUtOGIxYmFmZjkyZThk%252CPT0%253D%252CQ2xpZW50IHByZXNlbnRhdGlvbg%253D%253D%252Flf1f828794-74d6-40d7-91fc-2bcd9b6f51df//?mode=view&parentPath=sessionStorage' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>101 deck</a> + <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/app?ContentId=cc14ec33-2c68-4c63-9a4b-6f197edde734#/doccenter/f6bc8873-d580-4ee8-a903-c4e0d3a7eee9/doc/%252Fdd85c941b1-5f54-2314-ce72-b98c4c0974c2%252FdfOTRiYmU4NTQtNWY4NC03Y2QyLWZjYWUtOGIxYmFmZjkyZThk%252CPT0%253D%252CU2VsbGVyIGVuYWJsZW1lbnQ%253D%252Flf1c1424d1-b873-4ee5-965a-5bc8c0c93f11//?mode=view&parentPath=sessionStorage' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>recording</a> and work to position a <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCP2VHgPg77ppGCHhdTbTggbqXgG' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>A Proof of Value engagement</a>. <br/><br/>


## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Turbonomic has a very specific, proven path to prove value to the customer and gain approval to proceed with a longer, typically paid, engagement. This path includes a Proof of Value exercise. Proof of value typically takes 30 days and is free to the customer. The result is a set of recommended actions that the customer should take to improve the performance of their applications and reduce wasted resources. See the Proof of Value enablement <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCP2VHgPg77ppGCHhdTbTggbqXgG' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>deck</a> and <a href='https://vmturbo.wistia.com/medias/c22xqpkkfd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>recording</a>. <br/><br/>
The current model for performing Proof of Value engagements would be for an IBM CSM to partner with **Turbonomic Sales Engineering**, another IBM CSM or Tech Seller that is skilled in Turbonomic and has completed the <a href='https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/URL-F974437B4E1A?planId=PLAN-2CDD308CEEFD&sectionId=SECTION-A' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>6-week formal training and certification program</a>. While the presentation may imply that it is a simple activity, the reality is that it requires practice and a good first impression on the ease of use for Turbonomic is essential.<br/><br/>
A skilled IBM CSM might play both the role of the "Manager" (Technical Account Manager in the Turbonomic world) and the "Tech" in the engagement view on slide 9 of the presentation above. The presentation above describes how to engage **Turbonomic Sales Engineering**, alternatively you can reach out to Hollis Chui to get connected.

## Who is responsible for what, when?
**Sales Phase**: <br/>
*Turbo Sales, IBM Sales, IBM Tech Sales*: Close deal, identify sponsor, define success criteria <br/><br/>
*Turbo Sales Engineering, IBM Tech Sales*: Perform POV, present Business Impact Presentation (BIP), gain agreement for Technology Expert Labs/Professional services <br/><br/>
**Post-sales POV stage** (in the event that POV was not performed during Sales Phase): <br/>
*IBM CSM, Turbo Sales Engineering, IBM Tech Sales*: Perform POV, present Business Impact Presentation (BIP), gain agreement for Technology Expert Labs/Professional services <br/><br/>
**Deployment Phase**: <br/>
*Turbo Professional Services, IBM Technology Expert Labs*: Propose services and create DOU, execute DOU and deliver value to the customer <br/><br/>
*IBM CSM, IBM Tech Sales, Turbo Professional Services, IBM Technology Expert Labs*: identify areas for expansion and increased usage <br/><br/>


## What do CSM-driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2022-csm-spotlight/roma-capitale' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Roma Capitale</a> is one of our first IBM CSM driven Turbonomic deployments. Riccardo and Gianluca worked with Expert Labs and a Business Partner to install Turbonomic, conduct a Proof of Value against Hyper-V (130 VMs and 1000 containers) and assist the customer in implementing the suggested changes.

## How do I expand and grow Turbonomic usage?

The proven Turbonomic model is to land and expand by starting with a single application or line of business, prove value and the expand to other applications and business units. The "value" of Turbonomic is easily quantifiable by looking at the following:

  * Reduction in performance-related incidents
  * Reduction in the number of hours spent fixing issues after they occur
  * Reduction in wasted resources and cloud spending/costs

The outcome of the Proof of Value is an estimate of the reduction in cloud spending/costs. Turbonomic based their expansion mode on comparing the estimate to the reality and publicizing that within the customer and offering additional PoVs to other interested business units.

### Special notes

Full transfer of business for Turbonomic to IBM will not complete until July of 2022. Until then, the companies are not fully integrated and act as two independent companies each with their own ledgers and employees.

Turbonomic has a CSM team, however they perform a different role to the IBM CSM and are more aligned to Technology Expert Labs. There is very little overlap in responsibilities between IBM CSMs and Turbonomic CSMs.

IBM, Turbonomic and CISCO all sell Turbonomic, but only IBM sold Turbonomic entitlements show in the IBM CSM Gainsight. We will not be bringing Turbonomic or CISCO sold entitlements in to the IBM Gainsight

_____________________________

## Frequently asked questions
