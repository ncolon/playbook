## What is IBM Event Automation and what does it do?
**IBM Event Automation** is a fully composable solution, that enables businesses to accelerate their event-driven efforts, wherever they are on their journey. 

The platform provides capabilities to help liberate events from existing systems, transport them to where they are needed and process them to generate actionable insights otherwise hidden in raw streams of events. It also includes a management and governance solution to enable event streams to be discoverable and re-usable by all, accelerating the speed of doing business.

IBM Event Automation provides three primary products (Event Streams, Event End-point Management, Event Processing) that lay the foundation of an event-driven architecture for unlocking the value of events.

Event-driven architecture is an integration model built around the publication, capture, processing, and storage (or persistence) of events.

The platform empowers enterprises with three main capabilities:

  * **Event Streams:** Unlock events from existing systems to become a real event-driven enterprise. Rely on resilience and security designed for mission-critical use. 

  * **Event Endpoint Management:** Catalog event endpoints so they can be socialized and discovered. Enable controlled self-service access via enterprise-wide policies that can be applied to multiple streams of events.

  * **Event Processing:** Full stack event processing to transform raw events into valuable business events, sense trends and patterns over time and correlate events to a rich and personalized context. Detect business situations and trigger automated responses.

## What are the pain points that IBM Event Automation addresses?
The key pain points that IBM Event Automation platform addresses are related to client’s journey in the evet-driven efforts:

  * Pain Point: Need to establish a way to turn raw events into valuable business events in easy and intuitive approach.

  * Pain Point: Desire to catalogize events, socialize events cross enterprise via a self-service access while maintain and apply enterprise policies.

  * Pain Point: Need to collect raw streams of real-time business events, enable existing enterprise systems to publish and consume events, maintain enterprise-grade standards schema management, monitoring, disaster recovery data replication.

## What do CSM-driven deployments look like?
IBM Event Automation is a composable platform which means you can deploy all or some of the capabilities. You should drive the deployment based on the customer requirements. Let’s break down the three main capabilities:

**Event Streams:** an event-streaming platform based on the Apache Kafka project and incorporates the open-source Strimzi technology. The product offers Apache Kafka platform for enterprises with added-value functionalities, such as:

  * An administrative user interface (UI) focused on providing essential features for managing Apache Kafka.

  * A schema registry to support the definition and enforcement of message formats between producers and consumers. 

  * Granular security configuration through Kafka access control lists to configure authorization and quotas for connecting applications.

  * Geo-replication of topics between clusters to enable disaster recovery.

The product can be deployed as a standalone installation, or it can be deployed as part of Cloud Pak For Integration.

**Event Endpoint Management:** offers the capability to describe and catalog Kafka topics as event sources, and to share the details of the topics with application developers within the organization. The product can be deployed as a standalone installation, or it can be deployed as part of Cloud Pak For Integration. You can also integrate Event Endpoint Management with API Connect by importing the AsyncAPI document that defines the Kafka event source. This integration provides the option to use events as part of your overall API management solution.

The product provides an Event Gateway service that handles the incoming requests from applications to consume from a topic’s stream of events. The Event Gateway is independent of Kafka clusters, making access control to topics possible without requiring any changes to Kafka cluster configuration.

Event Endpoint Management aims to be compatible with Apache Kafka standards, which means the products can manage and control any Kafka cluster. If your client has already invested in non-IBM Apache Kafka technology, then Event Endpoint Management can be an excellent added value to the Kafka deployment.

**Event Processing:** a scalable, low-code event stream processing platform that helps you transform and act on data in real time. The product transforms event streaming data in real time, helping you turn events into insights. You can define flows that connect to event sources which bring event data (messages) from Apache Kafka into your flow (Apache Flink jobs), combined with processing actions you want to take on your events.

Apache Flink is a framework and a distributed processing engine for stateful computations over event streams. In addition to being the processing engine for Event Processing, Flink is also a standalone engine you can run custom Flink SQL workloads with.

Event Processing aims to be compatible with Apache Kafka standards, which means the products can manage and control any Kafka cluster. If your client has already invested in non-IBM Apache Kafka technology, then Event Processing can be an excellent added value to the Kafka deployment.

We will provide more information and deployment journeys as we actively start Event Automation deployments.

One of the first IBM Event Automation engagements is hapenning at Jaguar Land Rover.
You can get an understanding of the CSM led engagement and what is being done from the below slides and recording:

You can deploy Event Streams and Event Endpoint Management using Cloud Pak for Integration or Event Automation license models. Event Processing is only available in the Event Automation license model. The three main capabilities are supported in vanilla Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments. Be aware that the Event Automation license model does not provide Red Hat OpenShift VPC, similar to what we use in Cloud Pak license models. You have the option to offer the Cloud Pak for Applications to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.Identify a pain point, sponsor, and use caseThe IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.

## How do I expand and grow IBM Event Automation usage?
Customers vary in the event-driven architecture maturity and you can drive more usage by enabling the clients in the different aspects of event-driven architecture such as collecting events, socialize and manage events, and process events.
