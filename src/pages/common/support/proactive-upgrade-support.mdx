description: Create a proactive case for upgrade support
---

If you have an upgrade or production deployment planned and would like to have IBM and OpenShift team on standby for any assistance, you can open a proactive support ticket with IBM Support at Severity Level 4. To maximize the effectiveness of the proactive case - it should be opened at least 5 business days before the planned activity.

Should you need assistance during the upgrade or deployment process, raise a new Sev 1 support case. IBM will engage all required resources - including OpenShift CoC & Red Hat to resolve the issue.

Proactive cases and proactive escalations are covered in detail on the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/software-support/support-key-services/support-engagement-escalations/alert-tooling' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Software Support Organization website</a>

In the IBM Support ticket, include the date of the activity and what is being done. You should also upload a must-gather to the support case to establish a baseline. If you're using OCS or ODF for your cluster storage, please upload a must-gather for it as well.
