## Your role

As part of the technical community, your role in this process is to see that your customer is getting the attention they need from IBM Support. You are not responsible for following and reporting back on the progress of open issues.
However, you can and should be an advocate for your customer with IBM Support. 

## Opening a support case

The <a href='https://www.ibm.com/mysupport' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Support Portal</a> is used to open and manage support cases. **As a CSM or Tech Seller, your customer should open their own support cases using their IBM Customer Number (ICN) as they have entitlement to Support.**

If you are working with an entitlement that the customer doesn't have support for (often in pre-sales situations), then you can open a support case using an IBM Internal ICN for product defects.

Use the following Customer Master Record Numbers (CMR) or ICNs to open a support case when the customer's ICN cannot be used.

| Brand | CMR/ICN | Geo | Country of origin |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| Sustainability Software | 5411129 | All Geos | |
| Automation | 4602209 | Americas | United States of America |
| Automation | 0004492 | APAC | Singapore |

If this is the first time you are using the ICN, you need to request access:

1. Log in at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Support</a>
2. From Manage account support, select Support access
3. Type the product name, the ICN and the country of origin (see the table above)
4. Wait for access to be granted
5. Open a support case
