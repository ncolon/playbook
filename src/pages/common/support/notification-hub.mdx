It is essential to react to customer requests with clock speed â€“ i.e. in Critical customer situations. The manual approach takes lots of time.

Enable yourself by setting up Notification Hub and get timely information about the cases your customer is opening, responding, updating the severity or other actions. Either by Email, SMS, Slack direct message or Slack channel message.

Going the extra mile and enabling your team by setting up the Notification Hub to post to a Slack channel leverages the speed of information flow as all the members of the channel will get notified.

## How to setup Notification Hub?

Follow the [CSP Playbook](https://merlin-playbook.us1a.cirrus.ibm.com/#/documents/14cfed5304a98b5f75caa21d08bb9126) on setting up notification rules.
