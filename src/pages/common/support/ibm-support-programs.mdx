## IBM Support Offerings
IBM understands clients might need additional time when planning to move to a supported version or might need a higher level of support. To meet that need, IBM is offering [three NEW Support Offerings](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/software-support/support-key-services/support-offerings). 

<br/><br/>

## IBM Standard Support
Customers paying S&S (Subscription and Support) for an IBM offering receive the following:
- Subscription: preventative care from product fixes, security patches, and updates
- Support: problem resolution via access to our deeply skilled, industry leading support professionals
- Access to on-demand support tools such as: digitial self service community, chatbot, cognitive seach and chat, expert community forums, online docs and best practices
- Severity 1 tickets will be worked 24x7 with an initial case response within 2 hours
- Severity 2-4 tickets are worked during regular office hours, Monday to Friday only. 

In general, each version of an IBM product will receive 3 years of support from it's release date. After 3 years, the product reaches "End of Support", and customers must purchase IBM Extended Support in order to receive the qualities of service above. 

<br/><br/>

## IBM Extended Support
For clients that are using IBM distributed software programs, IBM Extended Support provides additional years of support once products have reached the end of Standard Support for a specific version / release.

Year 1 of Extended Support (Initial Extended Support) includes:
- Support access for usage, existing and new critical bug fixes, no proactive security fixes

Years 2 through 4 of Extended Support (On-Going Extended Support) includes:
- Support access for usage and existing fixes only, no security fixes
