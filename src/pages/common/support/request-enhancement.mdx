## Request documentation enhancements

The process to submit requests to enhance and/or improve Cloud Pak documentation can be found in the [Cloud Pak Content Consistency Playbook](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/product-scout-program/scout-instructions/submitter-instructions)

<br/><br/>

## Request product enhancements

When your customer encounters an adoption inhibitor or seeks a feature that is not currently available, use the feedback loop to put it on the radar of the product manager.

Enhancements can be initiated by the IBM technical community, customers, and business partners.

<br/><br/>

## Product Scout

CSMs are part of the [Product Scout](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/product-scout-program/) program.

In order to help Product Management priortize product enhancements based on customer impact, the Product Scout program "crowd-sources" information about customers needing an enhancement from across all markets and GEOs from Customer Success, Tech Sales, Client Engineering and Technology Expert Labs.

Your role as a CSM is described on the [Product Scout Publisher Page](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/product-scout-program/scout-instructions/submitter-instructions). You are expected to quantify the impact of an enhancement for your customer and communicate it to your market/product [Product Scout](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/product-scout-program/scout-names/) and work closely with your scout to ensure that you idea is accepted, given a roadmap slot and delivered.

You can find out more about the Product Scout program on the [publisher page](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/product-scout-program/) and access the issue trackers on [ideas.ibm.com](https://ideas.ibm.com/issue-tracker)

### Additional resources for Cloud Pak enhancements

When your customer encounters an inhibitor to their adoption of a Cloud Pak, work with your practice lead using the enhancement process.  Some resources you may use during that process include:


##### Product manager monitored slack channels

Submit a technical inhibitor to the appropriate Slack channel.  Channels will be monitored by OM and development who can help you determine whether you have a defect or product enhancement:

* <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C01EFL1K9NE" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>#cpfield-cp4data</a>
* <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C01EFS697A7" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>#cpfield-cp4integration</a>
* <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C01E0TTGD63" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>#cpfield-cp4applications</a>
* <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C01E0TUDMM5" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>#cpfield-cp4automation</a>
* <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C01EFSAA9MH" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>#cpfield-cp4mcm</a>
* <a href="https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/CESAJF4PJ" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>#cp4sec\_sales\_enable</a> (existing Security channel)


Hot inhibitors will be categorized by OM and Dev as either a Defect or an urgent Inhibitor Enhancement Request.
