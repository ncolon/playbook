## Your role

As part of the technical community, your role in this process is to see that your customer is getting the attention they need from IBM Support. You are not responsible for following and reporting back on the progress of open issues.
However, you can and should be an advocate for your customer with IBM Support. 

## Standardized process
The IBM Support team has standardized the Support Engagement Process to be consistent across all products and teams. You should review the [Support Engagement and Escalations page](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/software-support/support-key-services/support-engagement-escalations) for information about the process. This page includes details on the client escalation process and channels, managed escalations and proactives, as well as SWAT, Partner or IBM Cloud assisted escalations.

## Engaging CSM and TEL Practice Leaders and leadership
The CSM and TEL Practice Leaders and leadership team are available to help with support cases that are not meeting the customers expectations. However, before engaging this escalation path, please ensure that you have followed all of the steps in the documented [escalation process](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/software-support/support-key-services/support-engagement-escalations).
