#### Guidelines

- Support extensions are not guaranteed to be approved
- Support extensions require Start and End dates specific to the issue and request
- Support extensions require specific info on what products and versions are affected, and why the support extension is necessary
- Support extensions are considered on a case-by-case basis for each customer and their specific needs
- Support extensions may require approval from several Red Hat teams, such as Engineering, Product Management, and Support
- Support extensions are temporary fixes to issues that cannot be resolved via the standard Support Delivery process
- Support extensions do not include full product testing against all involved products
- There is no formal SLA on requests
  - Expect at least 1 week for the approval process on simple requests
  - Complicated requests can take 1 month or more to complete
  - Please file a request early for best results.

#### Process

- Gather as much detail as possible, including:
  - Red Hat and 3rd-party products and versions
  - Specific timeline that the support extension is needed for
  - How the customer will work to resolve the situation that they need the support extension
- Provide those details to the Red Hat Partner Success team via an email
  - Address the email to: dayc@us.ibm.com, jdolling@redhat.com, dlawrenc@redhat.com, amiftah@redhat.com, gtraylor@us.ibm.com
- The Red Hat Partner Success team will submit the support extension request to the Product Management team, who works to get approval from all involved teams and departments
- Once approved, the support extension information is entered into Red Hat's Salesforce instance for viewing by anyone with access to our system.

## Request for Extended Support for Red Hat OpenShift R4.6 & R4.8

If your customer is still an active Cloud Pak customer that has not upgraded their RHOCP to a supported release and is still running RHOCP R4.6 & R4.8 (both of which are out of support). Red Hat is offering a short-extended support period, May - September 2023, to help provide a bridge for customers to complete their upgrades for a fee. For details on the program, see the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/redhat/rhocp-extended-support' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>RHOCP Extended Support publisher page</a>.
