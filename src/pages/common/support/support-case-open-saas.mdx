## Your role

As part of the technical community, your role in this process is to see that your customer is getting the attention they need from IBM Support. You are not responsible for following and reporting back on the progress of open issues.
However, you can and should be an advocate for your customer with IBM Support. 

## Opening a support case

The <a href='https://www.ibm.com/mysupport' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Support Portal</a> is used to open and manage support cases. **As a CSM or Tech Seller, your customer should open their own support cases using their IBM Customer Number (ICN) as they have entitlement to Support.** There is one exception though, that in the case of Support Cases you need with SaaS products on **IBM Cloud**, open cases by following the instructions at <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-open-case&interface=ui" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> Creating Support Cases on IBM Cloud</a>

If you are working with an entitlement that the customer doesn't have support for (often in pre-sales situations), then you can open a support case using an IBM Internal ICN for product defects.  To get a list of IBM Internal ICNs, refer to the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/support/support-case-open/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>following support page</a>
If this is the first time you are using the ICN, you need to request access:


1. Log in at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Support</a>
2. Click on "Open a Case"
3. In the General section, Select the Type of support you need. Product Support will be used for for IBM and non IBM manufactured products.
4. Enter a Case title, to describe your case. The maximum length of the case title is 255 characters.
4. Under Product Manufacturer, type IBM
5. In Product, enter either the product name or its type. For example "App Connect Enterprise Cloud Service". When you start adding a product name, a list will automatically start showing up.  For SaaS cases, you need to pick the option that ends with "Cloud Service".
6. For the rest of the fields, add your information like the severity, Account, Description and Severity.
7. Click on "Submit Case".

## Opening Cases Through Support Chat
You can also open a case through support offered in a Watson chat. Click Chat with Support from any page in the Support site. In the chat window, send the keywords Open a case. After you confirm that you want to open a case, Watson brings you to the Open a case page and copies the transcript from your chat into the case description. Follow the previous steps to open the case.
