## Your CSM role

As part of the technical community, your role in this process is to see that your customer is getting the attention they need from IBM Support. You are not responsible for following and reporting back on the progress of open issues.
However, you can and should be an advocate for your customer with IBM Support. 

## Your PM role in TEL 

As a dedicated Project Manager within the TEL Delivery community, your contribution is to ensure your customers receive the focused assistance they require from IBM Support. While you aren't tasked with the responsibility of tracking and updating the status of ongoing issues, your influential role enables you to champion your customers' cause with IBM Support and can play a pivotal role in support cases that directly impact your delivery on the project.

## CSM and TEL roles

To empower you as a reliable advocate, a range of effective tools is at your disposal as an integral part of the IBM team. Some of these tools cater to specific roles, while others can be harnessed by all IBM professionals who directly engage with customers. 

You will find details on how to request access to and proficiently use each of these tools here. Your proactive engagement with these resources can fortify your position as a strong advocate for our valued customers.

## Introducing IBM Support to your customer 

**NEW** IBM Support has created <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/software-support/support-briefing-documents">customer facing materials</a>  that you can use to introduce IBM Support programs and practies to your customer. Use the Executive Guide and tailor the Client Guide for your customer to prepare them to be able to open support cases and provide the required information for quick resolutions. 

### Information regarding Case Severity
Review the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/739151">public website</a> for severities customers can assign to their support case. Ensure that the case severity mirrors the associated business impact listed in this table.

- **Severity 1: Critical System or Service Down**: Business critical functionality is inoperable, or a critical interface has failed. This usually applies to a production environment and indicates an inability to access products or services resulting in a critical impact on operations. This condition requires an immediate solution. **Note:** IBM will work with the customer 24 hours a day, seven days a week to resolve Severity 1 problems provided the customer has a technical resource available to work during those hours. The customer must reasonably assist IBM with any problem diagnosis and resolution. **For IBM Cloud services**, the customer must log a Service Down case within 24 hours of first becoming aware that there is a critical business impact and the Cloud service is not available.
- **Severity 2: Significant**:	A product, service, business feature, or function of the product or service is severely restricted in its use, or the customer is in jeopardy of missing business deadlines.
- **Severity 3: Some**: The product, service or functionality is usable, and the issue does not represent a significant impact on operations.
- **Severity 4: Minimal**:	An inquiry or non-technical request.

## Support Tools
There are many different support tools available to CSMs. This section will cover what each tool does and how to gain access.

### Getting approved for Trust Policy Services
When you need quick access to a support case, you need pre-approved access to Trust Policy Services. This access requires your manager's approval, so do this right now and you won't be stuck later. Follow <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://merlin-playbook.us1a.cirrus.ibm.com/#/documents/d8ef83556dd220e40cfa1445bfd2c3fb">these directions</a>.

Once you have Trust Policy Services access, when you need to view a case and don't have access the case, go directly to the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://tps.intranet.ibm.com/tools/support/tat/csp/cspCustomerTab">CSP Data Access Page</a>, and enter the customer number (CMR/ICN) associated with that case. You can copy that from the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/clsn3wfz3yt0l98e8a1puha20yxdih4z">Case Report</a>. If you click on a case and it says you don't have access, follow the link on the page to request access.

<AccordionItem title='Case Viewer'>
The <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://w3.ibm.com/tools/caseviewer/">IBM Case Viewer</a> is a great place to view a support case that has a 'TS' prefix (most Cloud Paks and related Point Product offerings). <br/><br/>
Case Viewer allows a user to search for Support Cases using a Support Case Number, IBM Customer Number or Product Name <br/><br/>

*Gaining access*: options exist to gain access to Support Cases to a **specific case** and to cases for a **specific customer**. Follow the instructions to gain access using the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://merlin-playbook.us1a.cirrus.ibm.com/#/documents/6761f002706803e8cfd2fbcb925fcccd">CSP Data Access Tool</a>. <br/><br/>

*Searching for cases*:
 - it is easiest if you already have the IBM Support Case Number and enter that in the search box
 - if you know your customers IBM Customer Number, you can search for cases using that, however, you will only be able to see the 100 most recent cases. **IBM SmartCare** will be able to show you all the cases for an ICN <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

*What useful information can you see?*:
 - Product Name: this helps you to understand which Product the case was opened against. Cloud Pak customers often open tickets using Point Product names.
 - Contact Name (and contact information): this is the name of the person at the Customer that will receive updates on the Support Case.
 - Owner: this is the IBM Support Engineer assigned to the Support Case and is the main focal point on the IBM side.
 - Must Gather: information about the product and environment. **This includes the Business Impact Statement**
 ![View tickets](../images/support-case-1.png)
 - Diagnostics: links to the files uploaded by the customer. You will not have access to view the contents of these files.
 - Public Comments: these comments are visible to the customer in their support portal.
 - IBM Internal Comments: conversations between IBM Support teams and Development. You should not relay the information in these comments to the customer.

<AccordionItem title='Notification Hub'>
Set up rules in <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://nhub.csptools1.ibm.com/#/">IBM Notification Hub</a> to notify you whenever one of your customers opens a severity level 1 (Sev 1) support case for your product set.  <br/><br/>
When you get that notification, you may choose to reach out and let the customer know that you are aware, and IBM is on it.  Watch the case in Case Viewer and set up another Notification Hub rule to notify you of any update in that case.  Remember that your notifications can be sent to a Slack channel or direct message, SMS, email and more. <br/><br/>
The benefits are showing the customer you care, building relationships, credibility and trust for IBM and you. They will be grateful, less angry, and much more likely to talk with you about future opportunities.

- You can also **drill-down** into the support cases. By default, the CSP Software Case view will show you the open Support Cases by Group and Severity. Click on any of the bars to drill into the data
![View tickets](../images/smartcare-opencases.png)

<br/>

- You can then use the search criteria to look at all Support Cases for the customer by changing the **Group**, **Product** and/or **Status** filters. It is easier to set Group=all to begin with to locate the Group that the product you are search for is in (Cloud Paks seem to be in either Business Software or Cloud). Clicking on any case will take you to the IBM Case Viewer. You can also export the data to a spreadsheet.
