## watsonx Deployments on IBM Fusion HCI

IBM is promoting a competitive differentiation with the ability to deploy generative AI models, datalake warehouse and model governance on-premises for clients who consider it undesirable, inefficient, costly, or complex to test or deliver elements of their solution in a public cloud. IBM Fusion HCI is fully supported by the IBM Software Data and AI product team as a platform in which all of these capabilities can be deployed with simplicity, speed and a single point of contact for support. A CSM should engage with the Data and AI Seller and a Storage Seller to develop a plan for client success. Situations in which the client does not wish to use Fusion HCI Lenovo hardware or the standard IBM appliance can be fulfilled with IBM Fusion software and the client’s preferred hardware. Please refer to the <Link to='/common/acceleration-plays/watsonx-fusion-play'>Fusion Play Page</Link> 

## Scope

watsonx.governance acceleration plays are mostly applied to a coordination around watsonx.ai Generative AI model management and/or expanding off of and existing OpePage, OpenScale and Factsheets entitlement.  Any of those deployments can be expanded using watsonx.goverance to enhance suppport model risk governance for Generative AI in addition to traditional machine learning models.  Clients adopting FMs and LLMs will have the ability to govern model lifecyles, collect model information via Factsheets and monitor for new risks specific to Generative AI (i.e. hate profanity, abusive content, PII data and hallucinations)

The scope of this play is to enhance the prepare, engage, qualify, and design phases (of the sales engagement model) initiated by IBM Consulting Services or IBM Technology Sales. As they progress these phases, Client Engineering conducts a client briefing, solution workshop, and builds a pilot.  You as the CSM should be involved in all stages to ensure a smooth transition of the entitlements. 

The chart below shows the deployment and delivery engagement summary:

## Engage/Prospecting Phase


**Led by:** IBM Consulting, Sales with CSM engaged<br/>

**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor



**What are the key value propositions to watsonx.governance?**


Applying governance principles to the development of generative AI models is of utmost importance. These principles ensure that ethical considerations, transparency, accountability, and fairness are integrated into the AI development process. By implementing governance principles, we can address potential biases, mitigate risks, and establish guidelines for responsible AI use. This helps to protect individuals' privacy, prevent discriminatory outcomes, and foster trust in AI systems. Additionally, governance principles promote collaboration among various stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and the public, to collectively shape the development and deployment of generative AI models in a way that benefits society as a whole.

**Business Challenges faced by clients:**
- **Heightens risks** **→** - Leveraging generative AI brings unique business opportunities but it also **amplifies traditional AI risk** and creates new business **risks.**
- **Significant penalties →** Non-compliance with regulations related to data privacy, bias, transparency, and ethical use of AI can result in severe financial penalties.
- **Impact on brand reputation** **→** Controversies surrounding Generative AI models can have severe consequences on customer trust and damage to brand reputation.
- **Lack of efficiency** **→** AI governance collaboration requires lots of manual work; amplified by changes in data and model versions.

**Business Outcomes clients may realize:**
- **Streamline** model monitoring processes, reducing time and effort for risk managers and model owners, resulting in cost savings and faster time to value for Generative AI initiatives.
- **Build** a repeatable, reusable and extendable architecture pattern to enable clients to configure additional models, integrations, and features to their existing solution.
- **Leverage** default governance framework for a selected LLM use case with validation
- **Monitor, catalog and govern** the selected LLM across the AI Lifecycle
- **Support** for any LLM technology platform (IBM and non-IBM)

**Process:** To have a meaningful discussion with a client about watsonx.governance, follow the steps outlined here, which provide background information and a simple process to articulate a compelling POV to start to investigate, plan, and deploy wastsonx.goverance solutions.


**Prepare:**<br/>

**NEW** Tech sales has generated a collection of use cases, architectural patterns, and more. Below are links to very specific pattern that apply to watsonx.governance that will help you in your conversations with clients.<br/>

| Pattern | Role |
|---- | ---- |
|[AI Governance](https://pages.github.ibm.com/technical-sales/generative-ai-ref-arch/patterns/governance/) | CSM |


Pursue the following **watsonx.governance Use Cases**:<br/><br/>

-**Governance:**

1.	Content Policy Compliance: Establishe a governance framework to enforce content policies and prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. This involves implementing content filtering mechanisms to identify and filter out potentially offensive or misleading outputs. Regular audits and updates to the filtering system are conducted to improve accuracy and keep up with evolving content policies.
2.	Bias Mitigation: Bias in generative AI models is a concern as they can inadvertently reflect and amplify societal biases present in the training data. The company incorporates bias mitigation techniques to ensure fair and unbiased content generation. This includes carefully curating and diversifying the training data, regularly monitoring and evaluating the model's outputs for bias, and iteratively refining the model to reduce bias.
3.	User Accountability: The platform implements user authentication and identification mechanisms to hold users accountable for their generated content. This helps prevent misuse, foster responsible behavior, and enables actions such as reporting and blocking users who violate the platform's guidelines.

-**Lifecycle Management:**
1.	Model Versioning and Deployment: Maintain a well-defined versioning system for the generative AI model to keep track of different iterations and improvements. This allows for easy deployment of new model versions while ensuring backward compatibility. Each version undergoes rigorous testing and evaluation before being deployed to the production environment.
2.	Continuous Model Monitoring: An essential aspect of lifecycle management is continuous monitoring to identify any performance degradation or drift in model behavior. Set up monitoring mechanisms to track various metrics, such as content quality, bias scores, and user feedback. This enables timely intervention and corrective measures if any issues arise.
3.	Model Updates and Retraining: Periodic updates and retraining of the generative AI model are essential to improve its performance, address limitations, and incorporate new training data. Establishe a process for gathering user feedback, evaluating improvement suggestions, and planning and executing model updates. This includes carefully managing the impact of model updates on existing user-generated content.

Other Business Requirement driven use cases could be:

-**Human Resources:** Enable fairness evaluation of AI models used for hiring decisions.  Provide risk management capabilities to assess and mitigate significant regulatory or policy breaches exposed by AI projects (e.g. NY HR Regulations)<br/>

-**Customer Care:**  Ensure agents deliver quality results both immediately and long term after placed in production without overhead.  Monitor chats for red flags of toxicity, personal info, or off -topic conversations.  Flag when responses are outside of social-norms and summaries are factually incorrect further reducing human intervention.<br/>

-**Business Process Outsourcing (BPO):** Monitor customer-specific process documents for Personal Identifiable information with customizable alerts.  Monitor NLU text models for drift, relevancy, and more for hands-off monitoring.  Support BPO activities across finance, HR, Procurement and more groups with dashboards and customizable workflows.<br/>
