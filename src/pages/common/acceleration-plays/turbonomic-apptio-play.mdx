## Scope
FinOps (financial operations) is a cultural practice to promote a shared responsibility to manage an organization's OpEx (operational expense). 

From the FinOps Foundation, "FinOps is an operational framework and cultural practice which maximizes the business value of cloud, enables timely data-driven decision making, and creates financial accountability through collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams."

A FinOps practice is based on the following  <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.finops.org/framework/principles/">principles</a>:
1. Team need to collaborate
2. Decision are driven by buisness value of cloud
3. Everyone takes ownerhsip for their cloud usage
4. FinOps data should be accessible and timely
5. A centralized team rives FinOps
6. Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud

## Why and Why Now
As more and more of our clients start moving workload to the Cloud and use Cloud services from different hyperscalers, their cloud spend will increase year over year.   Currently, over 30% of growing expenditure on cloud is wasted and clients are looking for more transparency into their cloud spend.
Digital leaders are starting to turn to FinOps.  With Cloudability and Turbonomic together, it will help clients on their FinOps journey as they go through the phases (Inform, Optimize, Operate) and mature their practice.

## When should I position Cloudability vs Turbonomic?
If your client is not currently using either Cloudability nor Turbonomic, find out the pain points identified by the sponsor and use the guide below to help decide which to propose.

## Positioning Cloudability to a Turbonomic customer
When the client is interested in advancing FinOps capablities with cost visibility, showback and chargeback, cost allocation and 3rd party cloud vendor costs.

**Target Persona(s)**: CIO, Director of CCOE, Director of CLoud Finance, FinOps Leaders
**Customer Characteristics**:
