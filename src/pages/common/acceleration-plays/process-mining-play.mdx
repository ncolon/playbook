## Scope

Process mining is a technique that applies AI to discover, monitor, and optimize business processes by analyzing available knowledge from event log systems and desktop interactions. IBM Process Mining enables organizations to identify the business processes that might benefit most from automation by using business system data to create and visualize an end-to-end process to uncover derivations, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies that are hidden in business processes.

This accelerator focuses on clients who haven’t deployed yet or want to discover and automate further. It also helps existing Business Automation clients to extend their Could Pak for Business Automation footprint.
