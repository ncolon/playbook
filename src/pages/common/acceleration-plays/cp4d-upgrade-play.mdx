## Engagement context for the upgrade


### Scenario 1: Client upgrade without IBM assistance 

In this scenario the customer wants to perform the upgrade without any involvement from IBM/external services support. In this case, the assumption is that the customer has the resources, expertise, and experience to upgrade successfully suitable to the complexity of their OCP+CP4D environment. In this case the CSM's role is to offer to: <br/>

* Take the customer through the available upgrade documentation to ensure they have all the available information they need for their planning, as well as to review with the customer how to engage IBM support in the event they run into issues. <br/>

* Review the customer's upgrade plan to identify gaps and/or risks, answer outstanding questions answered, <br/>

* Hold regular checkpoints with them over the course of the upgrade project <br/>


**CSM action:** Verify Client Timeline, Explain Support Process, Review Upgrade Steps, Review Documentation with Client, Review all components affected by upgrade (hardware & software), Identify Individuals Involved with upgrade, Ensure version compatibility of hardware/storage/software


If the client wants to upgrade themselves and in the CSMs opinion is not equipped to do so successfully, what should the CSM do?


The CSM should engage the overall IBM team to ensure that all decision makers at the client acknowledge the skills required to perform a OpenShift and CP4D upgrade. All the CSM can do is prepare the client and raise concerns to the client's organization on risks.


The CSM should work with their Technology Expert Labs Service Seller to <a href='https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7197619/Solution-Engineering-Request-Form' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>request a Solution Engineer </a> to engage in the scoping and planning discussions with the client. 

### Scenario 2: IBM Technology Expert Labs (TEL) hands-off keyboard consultation with client

In this scenario, the customer wants to perform the upgrade themselves, but wants to collaborate with IBM for the planning and execution oversight. In this scenario the assumption is that the client has the resources and sufficient expertise to upgrade successfully but wants to leverage IBM's experience to ensure they plan accordingly as well as have IBM present while they execute the upgrade. In this case the CSM's role is to<br/>


* Understand how much assistance the customer wants with the planning (have IBM review their plan [for free] vs have IBM assess their environment provide a plan as well as an execution runbook [pay ibm to provide the plan & runbook] and propose/coordinate the IBM resources accordingly, <br/>

* Understand for the execution of the upgrade how present they want IBM to be and which skills they want present, and propose/coordinate the IBM resources accordingly,<br/>

* Project manage the IBM resource participation and overall engagement model with the customer.<br/>


**CSM action:** Verify Client Timeline, Explain Support Process, Review Upgrade Steps, Review Documentation with Client, Review all components affected by upgrade (hardware & software), Identify Individuals Involved with upgrade, Ensure version compatibility of hardware/storage/software.
Provide or find help to instruct client on how to proceed.


- Identify your TEL Service Seller to engage a TEL Solution Engineer

If another IBM Business Partner is actively engaged, ensure they have adequate skills and experience with upgrading the latest versions of Cloud Pak for Data.


### Scenario 3: IBM TEL complete hands-on keyboard upgrade for client

In this scenario, the customer wants to pay IBM, or a partner, to plan and execute the upgrade for them. The CSM's role in this scenario is to:<br/>


* Engage Technology Expert Labs, or a Business Partner to work with the client to scope and propose an upgrade services engagement. <br/>

* Participate in the upgrade project status reviews between the customer and the services delivery team, <br/>

* Oversee the effective use of IBM support during the engagement if/when needed, <br/>

* act as the customer's first point of escalation should there be issues with the upgrade project meeting expectations <br/>


**CSM action:** Verify Client Timeline, Explain Support Process, Review Upgrade Steps, Review Documentation with Client, Review all components affected by upgrade (hardware & software), Identify Individuals Involved with upgrade, Ensure version compatibility of hardware/storage/software.
Provide or find help to instruct client on how to proceed.

If another IBM Business Partner is actively engaged please ensure they have adequate skills and experience with upgrading the latest versions of Cloud Pak for Data.


### Scenario 4: IBM Support SWAT Team upgrades


In this scenario, the client wants IBM to do the upgrade for them, but refuses to pay for services to do so. The CSMs role in this scenario is to assess the appropriateness of the customer ask and set the customer's expectations appropriately. For example, before even considering free SWAT team involvement, for simple upgrades, consider how co-participation with them is a better option. For more complex upgrades that meet the SWAT team's engagement criteria, the customer's expectations on timeframe need to be clearly set given free SWAT team availability. If the free SWAT team is the path taken, the **CSM's role** is to: <br/>

*  Engage the SWAT team on behalf of the customer, <br/>

* Participate in the upgrade project status reviews between the customer and the SWAT team, <br/>

* Oversee the effective use of IBM support during the engagement if/when needed, <br/>

* Act as the customers first point of escalation should there be issues with the upgrade project meeting expectations.


Review the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cloud-pak-for-data-client-experience/services/cp4d-upgrades' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SWAT Team submission process</a> to understand the process. There will be a lead time in scheduling so set clients expectations correctly.


**CSM action:** Offer Expert Labs first, if the client refuses (different than client preferring not to pay) then CP4D Upgrade SWAT Team would be the suggested route.
