## Why perform the QRadar Value Assessment (QVA) to promote acceleration, expansion, and growth for customers who have not recently purchased QRadar
#### For Customers:
Customers who work with IBM on a QVA receive a snapshot of their current state of what QRadar features are in use and which features they are entitled to but may not be aware of. The QVA can be delivered through a simple report or more likely a workshop where they receive a customized written report with guidance from Tech Sales and CSMs on these aspects. The report provides recommendations targeted to the challenges, needs, and objectives expressed during the workshop. It outlines specific ways to optimize the existing QRadar SIEM investment to better support their day-to-day operations and, ultimately, further improve their Security Operations posture.

#### For IBM:
This is an opportunity for IBM to increase the satisfaction and stickiness of QRadar SIEM customers! The QVA provides a forum to openly engage, to better understand the customer's QRadar successes, challenges, and broader Security Operations goals, as well as to ensure they fully utilize the platform. Additionally, a value assessment can result in organic opportunity identification, increased investment in license draw down, reduction of support tickets, and reduced likelihood of reversals.


## Run the play

### Task 1: Learn the play
Get familiar with the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/security/csm-security-qradar/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>QRadar product page in the CSM Playbook</a>.

The training materials can be found here: <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/tsjkscs5n368griw1mbm29i34rpio0t7" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://ibm.box.com/s/tsjkscs5n368griw1mbm29i34rpio0t7</a>.

The training recording can be found here: <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/88juls1bw9vuhenath0xodc3qf1vrb6o" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://ibm.box.com/s/88juls1bw9vuhenath0xodc3qf1vrb6o</a>.

### Task 2: Review and prioritize your target customers
By this stage you should have a good feel for what the Guardium Data Protection play entails and feel comfortable representing it to the account teams you work with.

The purpose of this task is to review your accounts that are targets for this play and identify which of those you will proceed to engage.  For those CSMs with accounts to target by your manager, you will find these here: <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/pmrhq0dpgic8auf1lj6rbecwjpas17da" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>target accounts lists</a> have been prepared for each market that identify accounts with active entitlements to **QRadar SIEM and have been vetted for inclusion in this play**.

For other CSMs outside of this play, if you wish to employ a QVA for your client, please get with your manager to validate and utilize the material in Task 1 above.

### Task 3: Develop your Gainsight R360s & Success Plan
After completing the prior tasks you should know which customer accounts you are going engage.

The Gainsight relationship type that can be used to execute this play is: **Modernize and Expand QRadar **.

Like all CSM deployment projects with customers, Gainsight Success Plans are used for each acceleration effort you initiate on a relationship. Success Plan project stages will be used to track and report on deployment progression.  Timeline entries on the Success Plan are used to maintain and communicate acceleration project status.

For the accounts you believe are not good candidates for the play, no success plan is needed at this time:
- Speak with your first line manager (FLM) and get their agreement that this is not the right time to pursue this play and no success plan is needed.
- Create a Timeline entry on the R360 relationship in Gainsight to indicate why this play is not applicable at this time.

If this play is applicable for your customer:
- Create a success plan in Gainsight and review the plan with your manager and/or another CSM.
 - The title of the success plan must be: #MP23 GVA or QVA
- A QRadar Value Assessment <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/csm-americas-deployment-plays/security/qradar-modernization-and-expansion/qradar-qva-gainsight-template" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>project description template</a> has been defined for the Use Case section of the Gainsight Success Plan.  Please use the template as the basis for your Success Plans, modifying it as needed based on the needs of your project.

For help in creating a success plan in Gainsight see: <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan</a>

### Task 4: Engage your customer and begin your acceleration journey
How to engage the customer and what needs done is laid out in the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/security/csm-security-qradar/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>QRadar product page in the CSM Playbook</a>.  The playbook defines how to conduct the assessment inclusive of the assets, templates, and the extended teaming resources to work with in each phase as you propose, plan, and execute the effort.  In addition, you should ensure that you have consumed and understand the training material outlined in Task 1 above.

You track progress of the play through the success plan.  Each stage of the success plan has specific exit criteria for the play.
- Identify stage - exit criteria to move to sponsor - You are discussing the value assessment with the customer.
- Sponsor stage - exist criteria to move to propose - You've gained agreement to execute the value assessment with the customer
- Propose - means that the Value Assessment completed with customer.

A key expectation of Security CSMs leveraging this play is thorough study and use of the playbook.

### Task 5: Complete the QRadar acceleration and expansion journey
When you have completed your QRadar assessment journey with your client, please mark your project complete.

You can also share your success with other CSMs by documenting your success as a CSM Americas Highlight story and a use case that others can use to start their own journey.
