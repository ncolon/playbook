A journey map for a software offering provides you with a framework and set of assets to help identify opportunities, gain sponsorship, and ultimately drive a software deployment. An acceleration play is a type of journey.

## Journey maps overview

These journeys were co-created by product management, Technology Expert Labs (TEL), Client Engineering, and Customer Success.
There are two types of journeys:
* **Modernization:** A framework provided to help a customer modernize an existing workload.
* **Acceleration:** A framework focused on driving net new workloads for a particular software product.

### Growth Plans for Journeys

<Column colMd={5} colLg={5}>

In Gainsight, when you create a <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan'>Growth Plan</Link> for a modernization or acceleration play, select the appropriate play by using the Deployment Play drop-down list in the Details section of the Success Plan. This will tie the growth plan to the play and will enable leadership to track the activities being done and the effectiveness of the play. There are also new templates available that you can add to success plans that are associated with these deployment plays.
