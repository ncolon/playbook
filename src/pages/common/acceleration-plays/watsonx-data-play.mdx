## watsonx Deployments on IBM Cloud

<InlineNotification>
To track progress of Deployments on IBM Cloud, you should create a CPP on Cloud Growth Success Plan on the IBM Cloud Relationship. <br/>
The usage threshold that must be met before the entitlement can be marked as Deployed is listed on the <Link to='/deploy/measure-success/#data-and-ai-ibm-cloud-and-the-cs-deployment-scorecard'>measuring success</Link> page.

## watsonx Deployments on IBM Fusion HCI

IBM is promoting a competitive differentiation with the ability to deploy generative AI models, datalake warehouse and model governance on-premises for clients who consider it undesirable, inefficient, costly, or complex to test or deliver elements of their solution in a public cloud. IBM Fusion HCI is fully supported by the IBM Software Data and AI product team as a platform in which all of these capabilities can be deployed with simplicity, speed and a single point of contact for support. A CSM should engage with the Data and AI Seller and a Storage Seller to develop a plan for client success. Situations in which the client does not wish to use Fusion HCI Lenovo hardware or the standard IBM appliance can be fulfilled with IBM Fusion software and the client's preferred hardware. Please refer to the <Link to='/common/acceleration-plays/watsonx-fusion-play'>Fusion Play Page</Link> 

## Scope

<InlineNotification>
Ensure you read the <Link to='/../common/data-ai/csm-data-ai-watsonx-data'>watsonx.data product page</Link> in the CSM Playbook Data & AI Product Section before planning your client engagement/briefing. 
</InlineNotification>

In this model, a CSM might be engaged in both pre-sales and post-sales activities.

The prepare, engage, qualify, and design phases are initiated by IBM Consulting Services or IBM Technology. As they progress through these phases, Client Engineering conducts a client briefing and solution workshop and builds a pilot.

The chart below shows the deployment and delivery engagement summary:


![watsonx.data Engagement Model](../images/watsonx-TEL-update.png)

## Engage/Prospecting Phase

**Led by:**  IBM Consulting, Sales with CSM engaged<br/>
**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor 


**What are the key value propositions to watsonx.data?**

watsonx.data is a next generation Lakehouse built on open source, which reduces or eliminates vendor lock-in cost.  Clients who have entitlements to watsonx.data potentially will be looking to enhance, replace, or augment their Data Warehouse and Data Lake implementation.  The primary focus on a watsonx.data deployment strategy is to provide flexibility in choice of storage compute and data compute to drive down costs and be more cost-performant.

**Process:** To have a meaningful discussion with a client about watsonx.data, follow the steps outlined here, which provide background information and a simple process to articulate a compelling POV to start to investigate,  plan, and deploy wastsonx.data.

**NEW** **watsonx expansion areas for pre-existing entitlements.**

## watsonx.data scoping, sizing and implementation considerations

The current engagement model highlights that Sales, Tech Sales, and Client Engineering should be capturing use case, workload assessment, and sizing data.  However, as a CSM or TEL Service Seller you want to ensure that all data is captured to have a successful deployment strategy.

**Deployment steps to focus on and ensure that the analysis and planning has been done:**

| Deployment steps | |
| --- | --- |
| **Validate** or understand the use case that was captured during the sales cycle or CE workshops. | **If no current Use Case exists, engage** a TEL Solution Engineer who can assist with a workshop (IBM Invest). <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE </a> |
| **Review** existing Workload Assessment that should have been captured by Tech-Sales, Client Engineering, or Sales. | **If no existing workload assessment, align** use case to workload type and assessment. <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE.</a> |
| **Validation of sizing** from Sales team or the Solution Engineer will validate the sizing and or recommend the proper sizing configuration based on the entitlements. | **If sizing information is not available, refer** to the watsonx.data sizing tools: <a href='https://app.ibmsalesconfigurator.com/#/zen/home' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> Sales Configurator link</a> and the <a href ='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC4QGj6Q4Bjm487X6jp6dqm2QGqd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>watsonx.data T-Shirt Sizing</a> |
| **Proper sizing and workload assessment** (driven by a agreed upon use case) will dictate deployment strategy | **If this is to be a SaaS deployment of watsonx.data**<br/> **Request** the provisioning documentation for SQA from the sales team.<br/> **Understand how to onboard** a client to IBM Cloud <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/vt5bhdeh8pq65j20wlez3f0b5ias0m0p' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a> | 
| **Review** the watsonx.data implementation offerings from TEL for watsonx.data <a href='http://ibm.biz/watsonx-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a> | |
