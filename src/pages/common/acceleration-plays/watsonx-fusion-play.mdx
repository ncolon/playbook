## Scope

This play deals with the design, provision and integration of Fusion HCI infrastructure to provide compute and storage services for watsonx AI, Data and Governance, particularly focusing on watsonx.Data.

<InlineNotification>
This play will typically run alongside the existing watsonx <Link to='./watsonx-ai-play'>AI</Link>, <Link to='./watsonx-ai-data'>Data </Link> and <Link to='./watsonx-ai-governance'>Governance </Link> plays and is focused on providing the storage, compute and data services requirements of these plays on-prem with Fusion HCI.
</InlineNotification>

In this model, a CSM will typically be engaged in both pre-sales and post-sales activities, you will need to work alongside other specialists in both hardware and software from both IBM and in many cases also Business Partners.

It is essential that the CSM fully understand the clients' business and their requirements for the particular project as building an effective storage and compute infrastructure is far easier and more cost-efficient if it meets requirements from the outset. To this end, the CSM should read and understand the following assets:

NB: The sales kits, in particular the Storage Fusion sales kit, are rich resources and time should be reserved to fully explore their content. Sales kits are continually updated, so re-visit regularly.

The prepare, engage, qualify, and design phases are initiated by IBM Consulting Services or IBM Technology. As they progress through these phases, Client Engineering conducts a client briefing, and solution workshop, and builds a pilot.

The chart below shows the deployment and delivery engagement summary:

## Engage/Prospecting Phase

**Led by:**  IBM Consulting, Sales with CSM engaged<br/>
**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor 


**What are the key value propositions of Fusion HCI with watsonx?**

**For the customer:** Using Fusion HCI and Ceph to host unified data services, storage and computing will deliver a simple cost cost-effective way to consume enterprise-grade functionality on what is regarded as de-facto reference hardware platform for WastonX. With Fusion HCI the data services and compute nodes are colocated alongside GPUs for far faster access to data for AI training. In addition, the HCI platform can be extended into software-defined or cloud providers of choice. Fusion builds atop RedHat OpenShift providing additional enterprise-grade services such as high availability, and replication data protection, all built into the product.

**For IBM:** Customers of watsonx.data have existing entitlement to both Fusion Essentials Platform Storage (100TB) and IBM Storage Ceph Data Lakehouse Storage (500TB), this will help build an initial deployment case. Neither Fusion nor Ceph will lock customers into a hardware platform - options to run on HCI, Ready Nodes, Software-defined, cloud or hybrid will enable customers to be confident they will not end up with a dead end in their Fusion HCI investment. Coupling Fusion and Ceph into a watsonx.data deployment will enable customers to grow quickly and easily; to become confident in Fusion and Ceph for their wider compute provision, their storage estate and furthermore to see added value over K8s or RHOS alone.


**Process:** To have a meaningful discussion with a client about Fusion HCI data and compute services for watsonx.data, follow the steps outlined here. This provides a simple process to articulate a compelling POV to start to investigate,  plan, and deploy wastsonx.data utilizing Fusion HCI architecture.

<br/>

**What are the Customer use cases?**

Fusion HCI provides many advantages of standard OpenShift, particularly for the operation of watsonx AI, Data and Governance packages: 

* Reduced Opex
* Simplified management
* Increased reliability
* Remove infrastructure complexity
* Enterprise resiliency for data and applications (HA, DR, Backup, Archive)
* Intelligence for data with a storage data catalog
* Accelerate data access across hybrid multi-cloud

## Fusion HCI for watsonx scoping, sizing and implementation considerations

The current engagement model highlights that Sales, Tech Sales, and Client Engineering should be capturing use cases, workload assessments, and sizing data.  However, as a CSM or TEL Service Seller you want to ensure that all data is captured to have a successful deployment strategy.

<InlineNotification>
Sales and Tech Sales may not have experience in the delivery of Fusion HCI for the provision of watsonx deployments. This may require additional scoping activities. Make use of your dedicated in Geo and Worldwide CoP resources, if you have any queries or concerns.
</InlineNotification>

**Deployment steps to focus on and ensure that the analysis and planning have been done:**

| Deployment steps | |
| --- | --- |
| **Validate** or understand the use case that was captured during the sales cycle or CE workshops. | **If no current Use Case exists, engage** a TEL Solution Engineer who can assist with a workshop (IBM Invest). <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE </a> |
| **Review** existing Workload Assessment that should have been captured by Tech-Sales, Client Engineering, or Sales. | **If no existing workload assessment, align** use case to workload type and assessment. <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE.</a> |
| **Validation of sizing** from the Sales team or the Solution Engineer will validate the sizing and or recommend the proper sizing configuration based on the entitlements. | **If sizing information is not available, refer** to the watsonx.data sizing tools: <a href='https://app.ibmsalesconfigurator.com/#/zen/home' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> Sales Configurator link</a> and the <a href ='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC4QGj6Q4Bjm487X6jp6dqm2QGqd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>watsonx.data T-Shirt Sizing</a> |
| **Proper sizing and workload assessment** will dictate Fusion deployment strategy. There may be a wide variance in required hardware and additional services, through the use of GPU, HA/DR, Replication, Backup, Archive, Data Catalog etc. Once these are finalized, final appliance requiremens can be calculated. | **Sizing tools:** <br/> <a href='https://www.ibm.com/tools/storage-modeller/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM StorM</a> <br/> <a href='https://app.ibmsalesconfigurator.com/#/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Cloud Pak Sales Configurator</a> <br/> <a href='https://sizer.ocs.ninja/index.html' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Red Hat ODF Sizer</a> <br/> | 
| **Review** the watsonx.data implementation offerings from TEL for watsonx.data <a href='http://ibm.biz/watsonx-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a> | |
| Update Gainsight with results from each of the steps in this deployment phase. | CSM |
