## watsonx Deployments on IBM Cloud

<InlineNotification>
In order to track progress of Deployments on IBM Cloud, you should create a CPP on Cloud Growth Success Plan on the IBM Cloud Relationship. <br/>
The usage threshold that must be met before the entitlement can be marked as Deployed is listed on the <Link to='/deploy/measure-success/#data-and-ai-ibm-cloud-and-the-cs-deployment-scorecard'>measuring success</Link> page.

## watsonx Deployments on IBM Fusion HCI

IBM is promoting a competitive differentiation with the ability to deploy generative AI models, datalake warehouse and model governance on-premises for clients who consider it undesirable, inefficient, costly, or complex to test or deliver elements of their solution in a public cloud. IBM Fusion HCI is fully supported by the IBM Software Data and AI product team as a platform in which all of these capabilities can be deployed with simplicity, speed and a single point of contact for support. A CSM should engage with the Data and AI Seller and a Storage Seller to develop a plan for client success. Situations in which the client does not wish to use Fusion HCI Lenovo hardware or the standard IBM appliance can be fulfilled with IBM Fusion software and the client's preferred hardware. Please refer to the <Link to='/common/acceleration-plays/watsonx-fusion-play'>Fusion Play Page</Link> 

## Scope

<InlineNotification>
Ensure you read the <Link to='/common/data-ai/csm-data-ai-watsonx-ai'>watsonx.ai product page</Link>  in the CSM Playbook Data & AI Product Section prior to planning your client engagement/briefing. 
</InlineNotification>


In this model, a CSM might be engaged in both pre-sales and post-sales activities.

The prepare, engage, qualify, and design phases are initiated by IBM Consulting Services or IBM Technology. As they progress these phases, Client Engineering conducts a client briefing, solution workshops, and builds a pilot.

In the engagement model, the **Implementation and Expansion phase** is highlighted. It shows how a CSM engages with Client Engineering (CE) and Technology Expert Labs (TEL).  The steps below enable you to prepare, present, and participate to ensure the client starts their watsonx.ai journey to deploy their entitlements.

## watsonx.ai scoping, sizing and implementation considerations

The current engagement model above highlights that Sales, Techsales, Client Engineering should be capturing use case, model assessment and sizing data.  However, as a CSM or TEL Service Seller you want to ensure that all data is captured to have a successful deployment strategy.

**Deployment steps to focus on and ensure that the analysis and planning has been done:**

| Deployment steps | |
| --- | --- |
| **Validate or understand** the use case that was captured during the sales cycle or CE workshops<br/><br/> | **If no current use case exists,**  request a TEL Solution Engineer to <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>assist in a Use Case Discovery Workshop</a><br/><br/> |
| **Review existing workload/model assessment** that should have been captured by TechSales, Client Engineering, or Sales<br/><br/> |**If there is no existing workload/model assessment**, then align use case to workload type. <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE</a><br/><br/> |
| **Validation of sizing** from Sales team or the Solution Engineer will validate the sizing and or recommend the proper sizing configuration based on the entitlements.<br/><br/> |**If no sizing information is available** for the entitlement, refer to the watsonx.ai <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC2hQWQHhF4678cMqghMQqPq94CP' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>T-shirt sizing</a><br/><br/>
| **Proper sizing and workload assessment** (driven by an agreed upon use case) will dictate deployment strategy<br/><br/> | **If this is to be a SaaS Deployment of watsonx.data**<br/> **Request** the provisioning documentation for SQA from the sales team. <br/> **Understand how to onboard** a client to IBM Cloud <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/vt5bhdeh8pq65j20wlez3f0b5ias0m0p' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a><br/> |
