## Scope
Accelerating the expansion of IBM TRIRIGA is the process of taking customers from a single use case or use of a single functional area, into additional use cases within a module or the use of additional modules or integration with other IBM SSW products.

## TRIRIGA Acceleration Journey
CSMs should concentrate on leveraging the messages, tools and methods described in TRIRIGA Winning Conversations.  At present there are three cross-industry and one public sector TRIRIGA Winning Conversations outlined below:

<Row>

## Strategic Real Estate Asset Management (STREAM) (Cross-Industry)
Corporate real estate groups are hampered by fractured, disparate and disconnected systems. Disjointed systems increase costs, limit reporting and prevent timely response to critical events.
Space re-alignment in the aftermath of the pandemic, increased M&A, more frequent business continuity events, expanded sustainability reporting, and anticipation of ever-changing market conditions require inter-connected real estate lifecycle data to remove latency and empower enterprises to act with precision while maintaining central control and efficiency.  Cost cutting is critical as corporate real estate portfolios.

</Row>

## Sustainable Operations: Sustainable Facilities Management (Cross-Industry)
Real estate portfolios are among the top assets on most balance sheets and a prime focus area for attaining enterprise sustainability goals. Facilities account for about 40% of global energy consumption with an opportunity to reduce by up to 50%. To be effective, sustainability must be addressed throughout the real estate lifecycle based on three categories: the viability of physical building structures, the systems and components running facilities and the operational activities to maintain them.

Sustainability has new urgency as investors, consumers, governments and even an enterprise's own employees are demanding action.  Never have all these stakeholders aligned behind an issue before.  Sustainability will soon require action and reporting throughout the real estate lifecycle.

## Dynamic Spaces, Flexible Workplaces  (Cross-Industry)

## GASB 87 Shining Light on Leased Assets and Liabilities  (USA Public Sector)
GASB 87 and GASB 96 applies only in the US to Public Sector State and Local Government, plus special districts such as public universities, airports, public hospitals, water boards, park districts.

GASB 87/96 casts new light on state and local government finances and use of public money through increased transparency in financial statements to citizens and legislators. GASB provides ground-up accuracy instilling trust and confidence, removing the guesswork from real estate portfolios and leases. They deliver financial controls leading to improved efficiency, cost savings, and credibility in near-term budgets and forecasts.

Compliance to GASB 87 standard became mandatory in 2022, while GASB 96 became required in FY2023.  Some organizations will have selected their solution by now, but many are struggling or haven't even started yet.  There are many organizations still looking for a solution.

## watsonx + TRIRIGA - Art of the Possible  (Cross-Industry)
There are currently no pre-defined sales plays for leveraging watsonx with TRIRIGA.  But there are many possibilies being considered, and one has already been realized as outlined below.<br/>

**watsonx Assistant Use Case for TRIRIGA **<br/>
Pfizer's Global Workspace Services team challenged Client Engineering to present and validate a distinct watsonx use case in the context of recurring monthly TRIRIGA meetings between IBM Customer Success and Pfizer. A pop-up co-creation session provided the venue for shortlisting the pilot use case.  Go <a target='_blank' rel='HERE' href="https://w3.ibm.com/services/lighthouse/spaces/view/stars/documents/210850">HERE</a> for details, customer presentation deck, and presentation video.<br/>

**Led by:** Client Engineering, monitored by Customer Success Manager <br/>

The customer may want a workshop to engage their broader teams, a custom demonstration explaining in more detail the process of using watsonx Assistant with TRIRIGA, or a PoX of some description.
