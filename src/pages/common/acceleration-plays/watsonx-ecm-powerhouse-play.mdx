## watsonx Deployments on IBM Cloud

<InlineNotification>
In order to track progress of Deployments on IBM Cloud, you should create a CPP on Cloud Growth Success Plan on the IBM Cloud Relationship. <br/>
The usage threshold that must be met before the entitlement can be marked as Deployed is listed on the <Link to='/deploy/measure-success/#data-and-ai-ibm-cloud-and-the-cs-deployment-scorecard'>measuring success</Link> page.

## Scope
In this model, a CSM might be engaged in both pre-sales and post-sales activities with major Enterprise Content Management (ECM) accounts. This play focuses on applying enterprise content management techniques to information stored in an ECM system like the IBM FileNet Content Manager. 

Many FileNet deployments have millions or even billions of documents. FileNet provides extensive search capabilities based on existing metadata and textual content associated with each document.

Generative AI has been rapidly evolving, enabling different and more sophisticated interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) like those available in IBM watsonx.ai. 

ECM provides the foundation for organizing and managing content that AI systems can analyze and process. Generative AI can be used to enhance ECM systems by automating tasks, improving search capabilities, and extracting insights from content.

By utilizing Generative AI interactions among a selected set of enterprise documents, AI applies LLMs to support a more flexible Q&A system that can understand contextual questions with the ability to summarize information from all the buried knowledge.

**Option 1**: Integration between watsonx (Data & AI) platform and the FileNet/ECM solution.
