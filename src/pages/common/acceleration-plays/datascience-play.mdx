watsonx.ai notice:

This current data science accelerator provides the assets and the means to initiate a data science driven use case and deployment discussion with the client. While watsonx has been announced, the GA of the specific offerings: watsonx.data, watsonx.ai and watsonx.governance will be staggered across the next few quarters.

*This accelerator will be enhanced as watsonx.x offerings come to market.*

## Scope

Organizations are embracing data science into formal business processes at a large scale.  Most organizations today have either attempted or are deploying various algorithmic models in various stages of success or frustration.

Some companies assume that they are using data science models but instead are only scratching the surface.

IBM Data Science technologies provide a robust platform to deploy many types of algorithmic models as well as enforce ethical practices to mitigate risk.  Poor data or badly deployed algorithms may lead to ethical or compliance charges.  Enterprise grade data science requires the flexibility of open source technology but the security and privacy of a robust platform.

The intent of this accelerator is to have a engaging discussion with clients in moving their data science to the next level and to take advantages of the latest technologies that IBM has to offer in the Data & AI space.

## Engage Client phase

**Led by:** Customer Success and/or Technical Seller

**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor

To validate that a client is a good candidate for a Data Science Acceleration dicussion, try to answer or gain insight from the client against these criteria:

- Business wants faster time to market with innovation in product/service
- Business wants greater accuracy in line of business
- Business wants Improved Customer Experience
- Risk and Compliance officer wants enhanced security and complaince in Data Science Practice
- The client has discussed use case(s) i.e. Fraud, AML, Loan Default Prediction, etc.
- Has a Data Science team using disparate tools and are growing frustrated.
- Interested in unifying processes, tools and talent in Data Science.
- The client wants to combine predictive and prescriptive analytics.
- The client wants to leverage existing cloud and data investments to avoid lock-in (Open Source).
- The client wants to do more than AutoAI provides by itself.
- The client wants to provide a broader Low Code/Pro Code mix to users

Before entering this phase it is necessary to have discussed the positioning of IBM Data Science services and products with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.

- Identify and work with your Data Science Tech Seller
- Identify your Technology Expert Labs Seller
- Identify any business partners in the Data Science Space

This phase covers the personas to target. Listen to your executive sponsor for key challenges and pain points and explain why Data Science strategies are important.

**Outcomes:**

The **outcome** of this phase is that a sponsor is interested and in agreement to proceed defining the appropriate use case and startegy for Data Science where IBM and the customer will work together to define the scope and success criteria.

Learn how to <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/client-engineering/engage/engagement-instructions' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>request CE to engage with you</a> on the accelerated adoption of Data Science.

You will need Technology Expert Labs or a Tech Seller to create an opportunity number in ISC for you to reference in your request for CE.

Start with a Proof of Experience (PoX) to help customers see the impact and value of IBM Data Science in their own environment with the identified sponsor and selected use case(s) defining the scope and success criteria.

**Asset:** <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/client-engineering/about/technology-patterns' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Technology Patterns</a>

**Outcome:**

The **outcome** of engaging with CE to provide a PoX to the client is that the client's executive sponsor sees the value of proceeding to further enhance or develop thier data science practice within their orgnanization.

## Propose, Negotiate and Close phase

**Led by:** Technology Expert Labs Seller

The purpose of the Propose, Negotiate and Close phase is to close a services deal. The IBM Sales team Digital/Services Seller, Solution Architect/Solution Engineer will present the customer with a Services proposal for Data Science engagements based on their budget and requirements.
