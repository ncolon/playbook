## Overview
As a CSM, our customer might ask us to provide information, guidance and assistance around security testing, vulnerability scans, and remediation of CVEs, or they might inquire about IBM's own security practices.
To help with this, we collaborated with the IBM Software CISO team to create this page which provides a list of possible questions a CSM might be asked, a process to request assistance, and links to IBM Software CISO resources.
As you engage with your customers, please take the time to share your experience and contribute to the list below.


## What if a customer...

| Scenario | Guidance |
|--------|--------|
| Runs their own security scan against IBM products and uncovers a vulnerability? | When this happens, the client will likely expect a response from IBM and a plan on the remediation.  To engage with IBM, have the customer open a support ticket and provide the required information outlined in this [video](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/eh8co3ixe0o2re7irhc9874ark3pmyqt) or [link](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-software-ciso-csm-playbook/responding-to-customers) (refer to the `What background information should be gathered?` and `What scan details are needed to respond?` sections).  Guidance is provided on the information to be collected, the minimum information required in a provided Vulnerability Scan Report as well as sample reports which contains insufficient vs sufficient information.  This is important to reduce the churn and expedite the investigation by the product and/or CISO team.  Additional information can be found in [Understanding Scan Vulnerability Reports](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-software-ciso-csm-playbook/responding-to-customers/understanding-scan-vulnerabilities).  |
| Inquires about IBM's security software development life-cycle? | IBM follows the [IBM Security and Privacy by Design](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-spbd) (SPbD), an agile set of practices which embeds security and privacy into the design of IBM products and services.  It is aligned with the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST's) [Secure Software Development Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf).  IBM also has an [IBM Product Security Incident Response Team](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-psirt) process which governs the management, remediation and disclosure of product vulnerabilities and provides a channel for customers, security researchers, industry groups, government organizations or vendors to report potential security vulnerabilities. |
| Inquires about IBM's application scanning and testing? | Per the [SPbD](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-spbd) requirements, all products are required to perform a range of automated security scans (including static and dynamic application tests, open source and container image scans) and penetration testing.  Refer to the [Application Scanning and Testing Requirements](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-software-ciso-csm-playbook/csm-enablement/application-scanning-testing) for more details. |
| Inquires about Cloud Pak Security Requirements? | Cloud Paks are required to follow enhanced security [requirements](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-software-ciso-csm-playbook/csm-enablement/cloud-pak-security-requirements) in addition to the standard IBM policies and standards which all products must meet. |
| Inquires about vulnerability remediation? | Per the [PSIRT](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-psirt) process, all product teams are required to track vulnerabilities identified by security scans and remediate within a defined period of time (not disclosed to customers).  Refer to the [Vulnerability Remediation](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-software-ciso-csm-playbook/csm-enablement/vulnerability-remediation) for more details. |
| Inquires about how to subscribe to IBM Security Bulletins? | Refer to the [IBM Security Vulnerability Management](https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-psirt) site for details and [subscribe](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/718119) to IBM Security Bulletins. |
| Inquires about IBM Cloud security and compliance? | IBM Cloud data centers meet or exceed a wide variety of industry standards in compliance and security.  Security Reports allow the client, their auditors and regulators to review the many ways that IBM achieves these high standards.  Publicly available reports for CSA STAR, ISO, SOC3 and more can be reviewed at [IBM Cloud Compliance Programs](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance) |

## Request assistance from the IBM Software CISO team
