### Business Challenge
Today’s agile businesses depend on IT leaders to deliver high-performing applications to support rapid change while saving costs and improving time to value. But achieving these results in complex, heterogeneous IT environments can be a challenge.  According to Kyndryl's website:

<Row>

* 'We design, build, and manage the systems that the world depends on'

</Row>

<Row>

* 'Kyndryl is the world's largest provider of IT infrastructure services serving thousands of enterprise customers in more than 60 countries. As a focused, independent company, we're building on our foundation of excellence by bringing in the right partners, investing in our business, and working side-by-side with our customers to unlock their potential.'

</Row>


<Row>

### ![goals](../images/goals.svg) The Mission
#### The Mission of the Kyndryl CSM organization is to enhance, grow, and modernize with IBM Software – retain, grow, and modernize workloads on IBM Software. Our Kyndryl CSMs work with Kyndryl and Kyndryl's End User Clients (EUC) on IBM Software currency upgrades, lift & shift same Software to a different platform and drive enhancements to containerized versions of the Software or with additional software. 

</Row>

<Row>

### Objectives

* Drive business value with Kyndryl and Kyndryl's End-User Clients (EUCs) by identifying use cases aligned with their objectives.
* Understand and utilize IBM Software usage patterns of the End-User Client and underlying Infrastructure.
* Team with Kyndryl to present growth and modernization opportunities on IBM Software to Kyndryl's EUC. 
* Minimize churn by enhancing IBM Software (e.g. complex upgrades, install additional software products and/or replicate deployments across the EUC busienss units), lift and shift to more modern Infrastructure, and modernize with containerized versions of the software.
* Implement a management system to measure progress of deployments.

</Row>

<Row>

### Success Factors

* Recognize value with Kyndryl and Kyndryl End-User Clients.
* Retain IBM Software contracted by Kyndryl for their use or their customers' use
* Grow existing client software install base and expand software into additional Kyndryl-led accounts. 
* Create and maintain a sustainable organization of high-performing CSMs for Kyndryl embedded with Kyndryl and Kyndryl End-User Clients on their strategic objectives around IBM Software.

## Customer Success Organization ![goals](../images/support-17.svg)

There are multiple CSM roles in IBM's Customer Success Organization.  The core mission of a CSM is to drive deployment, growth, upgrades, and retention with customers while continuously monitoring account health and expansion opportunities.

1. **Kyndryl CSM Architect:** Drives retention, expansion, upgrades, growth, and modernization of IBM Software whether Kyndryl owned or hybrid Kyndryl/End-User Client owned. 
2. **Cloud Pak Platform CSM:** Drives deployment, adoption, growth, and renewal of IBM Cloud Paks and Growth Offerings owned by the end customer.
3. **Sustainability CSM:** Drives deployment, adoption, growth, and renewal of AI Applications owned by the end customer.
4. **Cloud CSM*:** Drives client value by accelerating adoption and growth of IBM Cloud offerings.
5. **Brand CSM:** Drives client value by driving deployments of brand specific offerings. (e.g. zSW CSMs)
6. **CS Account Specialist:** Owns strategic relationship with customers and coordinates with brand CSMs. Note: Kyndryl accounts do not have an Account Specialist.


</Row>

<Row>

**Cloud CSMs focus on IaaS and PaaS including compute, databases, network  and storage software. For other IBM Software (Watson, Cloud Pak for Data as a Service ...) which are part of the IBM Cloud catalog, Cloud CSMs provide best effort if the client has these products in their install base (e.g. connect with tech support). SaaS is small scope of IBM Cloud currently so risk is low with this approach.*

</Row>


## The What

<Row>

*Kyndryl Customer Success Managers are an integral part of IBM in applying their expert level technical skills to enhance Kyndryl’s and Kyndryl's End-User Clients’ understanding of IBM Software capabilities and the value the software provides to their business. They work with Kyndryl and the End-User Clients to achieve and measure business outcomes. The CSMs protect and grow the full IBM Software portfolio through the relationships they build with Kyndryl and Kyndryl's End-User Clients with a focus on WebSphere Application Server (WAS), Db2,and Tivoli estates on Distributed and System z platforms and z Software (i.e. CICS and IMS). *
