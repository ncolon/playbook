## Pitching the Workshop

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">
Reach Out 
</SPAN>


Make a copy of the email template and customize it for the name(s) of the intended Kyndryl team (The target personas are CPEs, DPEs and Architects). Send the email. If you have regular interactions with your DPE or CPE, then you might not need to send the email and just bring it up as an offering that other Kyndryl teams are asking for and would like to know if you or your End-User client might be interested in something similar. If there is a positive response from either process, then set up a 30-minute meeting. Be sure to invite all your contacts to the meeting.

Prepare
</SPAN>

Make a copy of the presentation template. Modify it with your name and title. Remove things that may not be appropriate, for example, if your Kyndryl account has no Z components then you might want to remove some of the Z topics. However, it is recommended to mention the Z topics at a high level just to plant seeds and you never know what hall conversations are happening and it may be good for them to know that Z is a topic we can cover. Also, you probably shouldn’t remove competitive migrations. Kyndryl teams talk to each other so you never know who else they might share this with. Study the presentation. You don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics or products. You only need a high-level understanding of IBM’s position on the topic of AIOPs, Z Modernization, Data and AI Storage, Security and Competitive migrations. That can be gleaned from reviewing the main pages for those topics. There is no need to know the details of all the products on the technology choices pages. They are only listed there to trigger ideas from the Kyndryl team. However, you should at least have a cursory, one sentence understanding of what the product does. Nothing more than that is required. The idea is that if you want to know more, let’s include it in the workshop.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">
Deliver
</SPAN>

During the meeting present what the Innovation Workshop is and the value to Kyndryl, End-User Client and IBM. Hit the key topic areas. Be sure to take good notes about areas they are curious about or that they mention may be of interest to the client or conversations they’ve had with client about certain topics or products. At this point, you want to get to the conclusion. This is where you get agreement that a workshop would be good. Once you get that response then set a date for the pre-workshop planning session. If you don’t get a positive response, then see if there are other contacts at the Kyndryl account that you can reach out to and pitch the workshop. Feel free to share your copy of the presentation with the attendees. They may need to share the presentation with other Kyndryl teammates or their client to create the list of interested technologies.

## Pre-Workshop Planning Session

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">
Planning Session
</SPAN>


1.	The pre-workshop planning session is your opportunity to ask questions about broader customer goals and challenges. Think of this session almost like a discovery workshop where you ask probing questions. The reason they agreed to the workshop is because they have products and technologies in mind. That means there’s a reason they are asking about this technology or product. What’s the reason? Is it general interest? Do they have a particular offering in mind? Is this a concern from the client? Does the client already have this software or is this introducing the client to the software or technology? Get the answer to such questions and document the answers. You may need to bring up the presentation again as a reminder or an idea generator.


2.	Once you have the list of topics, products and versions you should talk about personas. We are finding that if a customer already has the product they have some level of expertise in the product and unless they have specific issues they will want to hear about new features, functionality and the product roadmap. The key is finding out what they want to know each product. That will help you figure out the right resource(s) to engage regarding the workshop. Sometimes it will be about new features and roadmap which means the product manager should be engaged. However, if they have specific questions like best practices or performance tuning or integrations then you’ll probably need a more technical resource. 


3.	Now that you have a list of products, concerns and personas the next thing is working with Kyndryl to determine how Kyndryl would like to present. Will this be some new offering for them? Or is it a technology upgrade that keeps them current and relevant?


4.	As you have this conversation suggest other topics like App Modernization, AIOPs or Hybrid Cloud. Just to see if there is a possibility to present some of the other growth plays that we are focused on.


5.	Round the meeting out with a rough timeframe so that you know what your targets are, and you can continue the planning cycle with your account.



## Post Planning Session
1.	Put together a sample agenda like this one for Z App Modernization:
	        - MQ v9.3
	            New Features
	            RoadMap
	            Best practices for monitoring
	        - IBM Control Center (ICC)
	            Value Prop
	            MQ Specific features
	            RoadMap
	        - DB2 / DB2 Advanced Analytics
	            DB2 v13 new features
	            AI infused Data Insights
	            Best practices around performance tuning

	            IBM Z App Modernization (Expose, Enable, Event Driven)
In the example, the customer wants to know about MQ 9.3 and wants to understand best practices for monitoring MQ so it’s listed in the agenda. Formulate a full agenda with list of products along with topics for each product. Since all these products are either middleware as related to applications, it’s appropriate to align them to our Z App Modernization growth play. At the end, we added a higher-level conversation to share IBM’s vision about Z App Modernization. As you can see, “Event Driven” is underlined because in this session there will be MQ teams so the focus of this App Modernization discussion should be around using the Event Driven pattern to modernize. Once again, we are planting seeds that may lead to further discussions later.

Once you have a draft agenda send it to your Kyndryl account for comment, review and feedback. Cycle through this as much as needed so that everyone agrees.

2.	Locate the speakers

Go to product pages and locate the product manager for each product. Schedule a meeting with them and share the agenda. Tell them about the CSM role and the goal of the workshop. If, for example, they are not comfortable talking to clients or can’t discuss best practices (as mentioned in the MQ example above) then have them suggest someone else who may be able to cover those topics. Pursue the leads until you find someone who could cover all the topics. You may need to engage with multiple people so be prepared. 

If it is a topic that you are interested in or have an expertise in, don’t be afraid to sign yourself up for the high-level discussion. The goal in most cases is to present enough high level information to either get the client to a deeper conversation or to a deployment.

3.	Build Final agenda
Put together the next draft with names, products, etc.	

<Row>
<Column>

| Session Title | Products Covered | Short Abstract | IBM Speaker | Job role |  Duration  |

This becomes the agenda that drives all aspects of the workshop, and you are ready to craft the final agenda that will flow like this:

 <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">

	- Introductions
    - Client(informally) 
	    Industry
	    Company
	    Interest in topic
	    How is it done today
	- IBM Product Manager
	    Product Overview
	    Value Proposition for this client

	- Q&A
	- Client / Kyndryl Feedback for any current technology they use in this category – IBM or otherwise
	- Things you might not know
	- Next Steps
	    Deep Dive
	    POC offering
	    Solution Architecture
	    Competitive Migration Sizing
	    Sponsored User
	    Modernization Review
	- Create a draft plan for next steps with owners and timetable
	- Meeting ends

If the workshop is broken up into multiple sessions the flow of the sessions should stay the same whether it is one product or multiple products. This flow has a distinct purpose to get the most value for all parties. For Kyndryl, this is to demonstrate them as a technology leader. For IBM product management, they get direct feedback from clients. For End-User Client, exposure to new features and technology and IBM direction. For us as CSMs, this is an opportunity for us to drive additional deployments. Each product listed in the agenda for the workshop is essentially a Growth Plan in the Identify stage.

## Innovation Workshop Exchange Session

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">
Conduct the Workshop, Document Actions and Follow up
</SPAN>

1.	You as CSM should be the moderator for the event. You own the workshop, and it demonstrates value that you bring to the Kyndryl relationship.
2.	Publish all actions with owners and make sure that product managers get the feedback from client that was promised
3.	Don’t forget next steps! Follow up with a deeper conversation, a Proof of Concept/Proof of Value , a demo or another action/follow-up that progresses customer intent.
