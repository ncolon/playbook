### IBM Sustainability Framework & Strategy



</Row>

<Row>

## Our Sustainability goal: Establish IBM as the leading provider of sustainability technology and consulting solutions

</Row>

<Row>

The Sustainability Framework was created to align our products and teams, communicate effectively to clients, and to enable a vision for how IBM capabilities come together providing exceptional customer experiences.<br/><br/>

As CSMs, we are at the forefront of how this strategy comes to life.  You are making customers successful by deploying our products in production environments.  You hear their challenges and you witness their wins.  Understanding the IBM Sustainability Framework and our sustainability goal in the market is essential to success.  Championing the framework with customers, while providing internal feedback which progresses the vision is what we ask of each of our CSMs.  It is an exciting time to be a part of IBM’s Sustainability team.<br/><br/>

IBM helps customers optimize operations and cost while reducing emissions and waste. Without tradeoffs
or compromising profitability, customers can use our leading portfolio of technology and consulting
capabilities to operationalize sustainability goals and business growth with an end-to-end, data-driven approach.<br/>
