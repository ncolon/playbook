## What pain points does the Envizi ESG Suite address?
Today’s leaders are excited and energized by the chance to reimagine business and commerce with a sustainability-first mindset. IBM Envizi ESG Suite removes the challenges and complexity of ESG data collection, analysis and reporting so you can harness the power of data to fast-track your success. IBM Envizi addresses these key pain points for our customers.

**ESG Disclosures:** This is one of the core challenges for businesses because investors are increasingly demanding that organizations publicly disclose their Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) credentials to external ESG agencies and frameworks, and following an increasing number of ESG reporting standards. However, not all organizations have the tools or analytics to do this accurately and efficiently.<br/>
**GHG calculation and reporting:** One of the most difficult parts of ESG disclosures is GHG reporting. GHG reporting covers not only an organization’s operations but also the upstream supply chain and downstream distribution and products sold. <br/>
**Achieving decarbonization targets:** Companies want to reduce their carbon emission, but many currently lack a roadmap to achieve this target. The purpose of sustainable businesses is to not just set a goal but to successfully attain it. Organizations feel all of the pressures previously mentioned; however, without a roadmap in place, they will forever struggle to achieve their decarbonization goals.<br/>
**Driving engagement and action:** Mobilizing a large organization to make steady progress towards those commitments is a huge challenge. IBM has even committed to net zero GHG emissions by 2030 and is continually taking steps towards achieving this.<br/>


## Envizi technical architecture
Envizi consolidates sustainability data from providers to create a single view and a common control plane for sustainability projects.
Take a look at this slide which depicts how Envizi's architecture simplifies the capture, consolidation, management and analysis of sustainability database.

<br/>

Starting on the left side of this slide, Envizi provides the capability to capture a wide range of data types, whether it is granular meter data or high-level health and safety metrics. One of the key tenants of producing financial-grade data is removing human error from the equation. Automating from the source and providing full traceability to that source are critical. Envizi automates data from several sources, including bill pay providers, third-party suppliers (such as fleet systems travel like Concur or American Express), and data from supply chain upstream transportation and distribution (for example, capturing data to assess carbon impact from deliveries companies such as FedEx or UPS).

Use Case 2: Streamline internal Environmental performance reporting<br/>
Use Case 3: Emissions Calculation & Reporting<br/>
Use Case 4: Streamline external ESG reporting disclosures to investors and external reporting frameworks<br/>


## Is Envizi a SaaS solution? Which cloud platform does it run on?

Envizi is a SaaS solution. It runs primarily on AWS but we also have one customer on Azure (Microsoft).

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

1. Before you engage with the customer, work with your IBM Sales/Tech Sales to reconfirm if a customer does not have use cases purchased. Then understand if during the pre-sales cycle, they had expressed interest in implementing any use cases <br/>

2. Once you have that information from your IBM peers, engage your customer to discuss and gain approval to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs <br/>

3. Do this with the participation of your customer organizations both IT and LOB department stakeholders either in a meeting room/whiteboarding session or through a MURAL session at the same time <br/>

4. If you need assistance on how to prep for a workshop and execute the same reach out to your Practice Leader - Poornima Kallur for assistance <br/>

5. You can also involve Client Engineering, and/or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement) to arrive at the right set of business outcome-driven use cases

 ## How do I expand and grow Envizi usage?

 Usage of Envizi can be expanded in two ways - an increase in functionality within the application by identifying additional use cases or adding more applications that derive value from Envizi.

 * As CSMs, you need to understand the land and expand model for Envizi and look at which of the 9 modules customer has started Phase 1 with and then initiate a discussion for other modules. For eg if a customer started with Scope 1, 2, 3 and Target Setting modules let us keep them engaged on new modules Value Chain Assessment and Surveys, ESG Reporting, Power BI capabilities and more.<br/>
 * Explore if a customer is looking at expanding geographically by adding more locations/meters etc., as that could be a potential expansion opportunity <br/>
 * Listen to your customers on their IT initiatives and asset management initiatives and see how you can position Maximo and Tririga as additional applications that can help their business initiative but also seamlessly integrate with Envizi to give a complete view of their portfolio performance<br/>
 * Driving expansion into new products or use cases could also be achieved through account planning and Executive Business Reviews with your customers which helps connect executives, understand customer roadmap for the year and position new use cases or new products.

<AccordionItem title='When should a CSM initiate the very first renewal discussion with customer and how long does the Envizi renewal take to close out successfully?'>
- Envizi is an acquisition into IBM which means, the legacy Envizi customers will have to move to IBM paperwork and new terms and conditions when they are up for renewal.<br/>
- If the customer is on legacy contract, then a CSM should kick start renewal discussion with customer's primary contact and their procurement team atleast 6 months in advance. This gives enough time for QnAs, clarifications, information sharing, negotiation, agreement to new terms and conditions, identifying the right site, right contract type and going through review and sign offs.<br/>
- However if the customer is already on IBM paper and is coming up for renewal, then CSM can initiate the first kick-off email or meeting at least 4 months in advance.<br/>
- Again it depends on the client satisfactiion score at the time, their plans for the upcoming year, new scope being added etc., which should give you a more clear indication of how early you should start.<br/>
- But if everything is business as usual and no changes to current contract then a 4 months turnaround time should be ideal for a successful renewal.<br/>

It takes anywhere from 4-6+ months for a successful Envizi contract renewal.

<AccordionItem title='Why do I see one entry under Entitlements in Gainsight for legacy Envizi contracts?'>
All legacy Envizi contracts were built on FCT (Flexible Contract Type). Post-acquisition and transfer of business, the migration of these contract entitlements show up in Gainsight as just one row. If you need to know what part numbers and quantities were purchased, copy the Service Agreement (SA number) from this row and go to <a href="https://fastpass.w3cloud.ibm.com/sales/fastpass/salesorders.jsp">FastPass</a> to look up the contract details for your customer

<AccordionItem title='SOC1 and SOC2 reports for Envizi'>
1. In 2024, we have a new program director of Security for SSW Christopher Ford. Any security questions on Envizi platform or SOC1, SOC2 reports he should be able to help us out with it. <br/>
2. For SOC2 report, please ask the customer to create a support case and support team should be able to assist them with the report. Each requesting client needs to have a NDA with IBM already, so support team will verify the same and share the report with client accordingly. <br/>
3. Envizi does not have a SOC1 report as of Mar 2024. The IBM Security team is working on a plan over the coming months to do an assessment of any gaps in the SOC1 requirements and make the final decision on timing. If there are significant gaps, the SOC1 audit would be scheduled for 2025. If there are only marginal gaps, then a SOC1 in H2 2024 is reasonable. <br/>
4. For client communication on SOC1 report, let us work with Chris Ford for a formal response. Reach out to your practice leader if any help is needed on either of these reports <br/>

<AccordionItem title='Envizi client references - Process to be followed for seeking and tracking references'>
Envizi being a recently acquired company by IBM, there is a great demand for securing as many customer references as we can, to build a strong sales pipeline across the world. <br/>
CSMs should ensure they follow the below listed process and help out the IBM ecosystem in not only seeking the references but also tracking it for long term engagement of customers.<br/>

<br/>

1. Download this reference consent agreement from this <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/206093777990" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>box</a> folder <br/>
2. Send it to your client and secure their signature via email. Clients will have to check the list of activties  they would like to participate in. Feel free to suggest to your client the activties that you think they can contribute to <br/>
3. Upload the signed client reference agreement to this location on <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/206093777990" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>box</a>. Follow file naming convention "Client Name - Signed IBM Envizi Client Reference Agreement Form" <br/>
4. CSM should fill out the airtable form at this <a href="https://airtable.com/shroXqANjidS5YAM1" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>site</a> to ensure all client reference activity is diligently tracked in this database. Other IBM stakeholders will be using this database to see which customers are referenceable <br/>
<br/>
Reach out to your practice leader Poornima Kallur (pkallur@us.ibm.com) for any questions on this. <br/>
