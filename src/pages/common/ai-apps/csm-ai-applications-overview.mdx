## Asset Management

Your customer's organizations are asset intensive, relying on hundreds if not millions of assets to stay operational. What’s more, assets are getting smarter.

Operating models must evolve along with the assets themselves, and that’s why enterprise asset management (EAM) is crucial. EAM is the combination of software, systems and services used to maintain and control operational assets and equipment.

## Supply Chain and Order Management

A supply chain is the network of people, organizations, resources, processes, and technology that are needed to create, distribute, and sell a product. A supply chain starts with the delivery of source materials from suppliers to the manufacturer. After the product is finished manufacturing, it is transported to a distributor, then to a retailer, and ultimately to a consumer. The finished product moves from the manufacturer to the consumer through a distribution channel.

Supply chain management oversees materials and products, information, and finances as they move through the process from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer to consumer.
