**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

See below for detailed instructions on how to view the usage for your account.

### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM Architect/Digital CSM | The client has implemented at least one use case and is receiving value.  <br/> <br/> Primary outcome of the very first use case - An Account Record has been added  <br/> | **Technology Expert Labs Offerings: <br/> <br/>(For Envizi Essentials there is no TEL offering in place today, but if you see a need for a customer then reach out to Justin Willock and Poornima Kallur. Will be reviewed on a case by case basis)**<br/><br/> **Expertise Connect Services:** Expertise Connect offers a continuous engagement model for clients to access technical guidance from TEL - Software deep technical expertise at a fraction of the cost of typical consulting engagements. <br/><br/> **Nurture opportunities**<br/> After the Product Led Growth interface in Gainsight is configured later in 2024, you will be able to track the activities that the customer is performing in the Envizi platform. This enables you to determine whether the customer needs additional assistance through their journey.
