## What are the latest OMoC vNext gen migration updates

Here is the summary of OMoC (Order Management on Cloud) migrations from v1 to v2 (or vNextGen).
* There are about 30 customers who are on OMoC v1. And we have migrated about 10 customers in 2022 and we had a plan to migrate the rest in coming years.
* Due to the resource constraints in the Dev/SRE org, we have committed to only 3 customers migrations (Fossil, Carters and Barnes and Noble ) and moved the rest (17) to 2024. This decision was made late February this year.
*	On target to complete these 3 migrations this year.
*	And for the ones that are being pushed to 2024, we have a mitigation plan to enable the vNext features on 1.0 itself.
  *	For the customers with whom we had conversations already (slide 3 ),  New Store, Call Center UI and Order Hub will be enabled on the existing v1.0 environment.
  *	For the customers where we didn’t have any conversations (slide 4),  New Store, Call Center UI and Order Hub will be enabled on the existing v1.0 environment in 2024
*	SIP & IV features will be enabled on v1.0 wherever we see an upsell opportunity.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='How do I connect to the IBM Team for help?'>

The best and fastest way to connect to the Supply Chain Product teams is through the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/community-connections/sustainability-software-community/asset-management-Supply Chain#Supply ChainAdvisorySlackChannels' target='_blank'>Product Slack Channels</a>.  There are multiple people on those channels that can answer questions or point you in a direction to get the answer.<br/>

The best and fastest way to connect to the Support team is through the Support Escalation process.  This includes when SRE is involved.  Leverage the Supply Chain Support Escalation channel (ensuring you have followed the process steps prior!) and call for a Managed Escalation when it is appropriate.  Err on the side of Support saying we don't need the Managed Escalation.

**Fleet Management**

<a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibmsaleszone/plays-work/ny-power-authority">Predict vehicle health to keep the fleet moving</a>


_The Challenge_

Despite using several IBM Supply Chain solutions to manage its generation and transmission operations, the New York Power Authority (NYPA) Fleet Department still used separate, standalone software for fleet management. This prevented cross-organizational visibility into vehicle information. With a myriad of vehicles, ranging from trucks to cranes to cars, NYPA employees needed a uniform, real-time view into vehicle status and history — such as which vehicles were available for jobs and which were already in use or in the shop — so they could both plan ahead and be ready to quickly respond to unexpected work.

_The Opportunity_

To support its digital transformation, NYPA had already unified its Supply Chain system on IBM Supply Chain. NYPA had several Supply Chain solutions — including the Assets, Inventory, Planning, Preventive Maintenance and Work Order modules — in place and had tightly integrated these modules with its SAP ERP and other core applications. The system — managed by IBM Ecosystem Partner Starboard Consulting — provided NYPA with a comprehensive view of approximately 60,000 power generation and transmission assets, their conditions and locations, and associated work processes. This helped ensure optimal planning, control, audit and compliance.

<br/>

With that successful deployment as a foundation, NYPA turned again to Starboard to support the migration of its fleet management to IBM Supply Chain as a part of its goal to become the first fully digital public power utility in the United States. To ensure business continuity and efficiency — and keep customers satisfied —  NYPA and Starboard deployed  IBM Supply Chain for Transportation — an entry point for the Data Fabric sales play — into the existing system. Starboard worked onsite to help define the solution requirements and begin development. The COVID-19 pandemic forced NYPA to put the project on hold, though when the project restarted, the team met virtually and worked cohesively to ensure a smooth transition from the old to the new system.

<br/>

> "In terms of their overall data environment, customers are focused on asset performance, predicting asset health, and knowing which assets provide the highest value. That's why we developed the Asset Performance Management Portfolio. Customers want to understand their data because they have a lot. Many customers haven't harvested their data, and they don't always know if they have the right data — but they do recognize that their data is an asset that they must understand and cultivate if they want a better view of the health and risk across their organization so they can start predicting degradation or potential failure of assets."
<cite>– Terry Saunders, Worldwide Utilities Industry Leader, Global Sales</cite>

<br/>

_The Results_

NYPA and Starboard worked together to organize the solution training and change management for 2,300 NYPA employees, including in-depth instruction for mechanics and other fleet staff. With use of the Supply Chain for Transportation solution, the Fleet Department can help ensure optimal management of approximately 1,600 NYPA vehicles. Now, employees who need to reserve a vehicle for a job or schedule repair work can view real-time information online and easily access a vehicle's entire chronological history on a single screen, including its preventive maintenance record and associated costs.

<AccordionItem title='Compare and contrast Supply Chain Visual Inspection to Cognex'>

Review this <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/d2u0iv6jna3lqhedchjgm1yzn8wbjbk4">updated competitive POV of MVI vs Cognex.</a>  It has been updated to reflect the AI capabilities Cognex has, which is not to be underestimated.

<br/>

There are concerns that a combat playbook will truly hold. Except Mobile and Supply Chain Suite integration, there are customers that have mentioned almost the opposite of what is outlined as gaps or weaknesses.  Customers can now build models and inspections by themselves without the need of services. Typically the initial setup is with services, but they get self-sufficient fast.  Additionally, services are cheap (relative to consulting services), because they are mostly provided by small local shopfloor SI (i.e. blue collar labor rates)

<br/>

**Other aspects to consider with the customer**

- Cognex allows you to draw a window of scope on an image, so only that gets inspected, rather than the full image, which allows to eleminate detractors
- Cognex has object detect, classification and anomaly detection models
- Cognex looks at themselves primarily as a Software / AI company. They still provide hardware, but are getting more agnostic (if needed). I heard about this, but haven't seen evidence of this.
- Cognex cameras start relatively low priced. Couple of hundred bucks for an industrial camera. of course open ended.
- A big differentiator is that cognex is 1:1, vs MVI is 1:n, in terms of deployment pattern. i.e. cognex scales linearly, while MVI scales more regressively (i.e. the larger the scale, the cheaper it gets) At low scale, I think it's super difficult to compete with cognex. The larger the scale, the stronger MVI is.
- Play more to the strength of Supply Chain Suite. Cognex is only inspection. Supply Chain Suite is inspection + health + predict.. and because it's open and API based, we can easily build even more complex things, e.g. combine sound and vision, or telemetry and vision etc


Philipp Schume of IBM Consulting Services has worked with Cummins, Magna, Lear, Gillette (at least) in a Cognex head to head.

- Cummins tried to find a way to make MVI work, but cognex was just stronger (too low scale of a conversation)
- Magna, mvi is in the discussion, but they use cognex for other things. wouldn't be surprised if they switch. But it's a more complex solution that we're building, so cognex might not work out (we're also using sound and telemetry data)
- Lear - ongoing, but I hear cognex is pushing hard
- Gillette - cognex incumbent, IBM couldn't convince them

** Report Administration application in Supply Chain **

You use the Reports Administration application to view report listings, set report security, and specify the availability of reports and how they open, run, and print.
- Report development - Reports display important information to help your organization analyze the data that Supply Chain® Supply Chain generates. The embedded reporting tool is Business Intelligence and Reporting (BIRT). In the Supply Chain Report Development Guide, you can find information on how to install and configure the BIRT report designer, and develop and extend reports. You can also integrate your Supply Chain system with Cognos or external reporting systems.
- Administering reports - You can add reports and data sources, configure reports, manage security, and monitor report performance so that users can quickly analyze Supply Chain data.
- Ad hoc report administration - You can specify which users can create and run ad hoc reports and define the types of analysis that users can perform.
- Ad hoc report creation - You can quickly create reports to get information for your business needs.

** Cognos reporting **

You can install and integrate Cognos reporting to enable powerful and flexible data analysis for your users. Administrators access Cognos reporting to maintain the Cognos reporting server, define security settings, and manage users. Report developers use Cognos reporting to develop and maintain enterprise reports. Power and business users use Cognos reporting to run and view reports, and create ad hoc reports. Application users use Cognos reporting to run and view reports. Users can see and access Cognos reports from within applications and Cognos reports are displayed in a separate browser session within the Cognos reporting application.

<AccordionItem title='Understand the update policy and support of Supply Chain Mobile for EAM'>

**Steven Shull - April 14, 2022**

Disclaimer - I can't make statements on our official policies.
What I can say is we don't commit to updates of the native apps beyond what is necessary. We may have 2 releases in a month or no releases for 4 months. It really just depends on a need to update the apps. For example, if a new iOS version comes out that requires us to update the native app.

<br/>

For the iOS/Android apps, are intended to support the versions of the Supply Chain Mobile apps we support. For 8.7 as an example, we changed how we manage data on the device and we support this new process as well as the legacy process in 8.6 and earlier versions. We want to maintain one version of the app.
For Supply Chain Suite, we currently support only the 2 most recent releases (IE 8.6/8.7 right now). That goes for Supply Chain Mobile for EAM as well. A customer needs to be on 8.6/8.7 to get support and when 8.8 comes out in July we'll drop support for 8.6. The 8.9 release is being planned to be a LTS release for Supply Chain Suite where we will support that version for up to 3 years. I've not seen any declaration about what that means from a Mobile perspective in Supply Chain Suite. I would expect it would not apply to the for EAM version because that would take us past the end of support for 7.6.1.X of Supply Chain.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title='Setup a Supply Chain Mobile Development Environment'>

<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6408032">This is the best place to start.</a>

<br/>

As far as tools go, you need a way to run docker. You could install Docker Desktop (which requires licensing inside of IBM that you can buy at <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/docker-desktop">Buy@IBM.</a> ) or you can utilize the docker runtime. You can do that on a VM or if you have Windows machines you can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title='Understand offline Mobile operations'>

Supply Chain Mobile App for Windows continues to work after turning the network to airplane mode for some time, could work offline for 6 days today but I wouldn't recommend it.  We have talked about implementing a customer defined limit to how long the app could work offline but we don't have anything like that today. - May 17, 2022

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title='Understand Mobile configurations'>


**Configuring with the new mobile apps that don’t require Docker and WSL2?**


Other tools that allow you to run docker containers (such as Podman) are also options but not officially supported today and would still require Linux (IE WSL2 for Windows users).  If the concern is related to licensing, you can install the docker CLI to WSL2 without installing docker desktop. The docker CLI does not require a license.


Note - docker isn't required to utilize the applications as an end user. - May 17, 2022

<AccordionItem title='Configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) security'>

<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mam/7.6.1.2?topic=security-configuring-assertion-markup-language-saml">Configuring Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) security</a>


You can configure the application server to use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). SAML is an authentication protocol that authenticates your session with an Identity Provider (IdP) rather than directly with IBM Supply Chain Supply Chain.

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title='Understand Supply Chain Mobile synchronization'>

Synchronization occurs when the device is back online. Because it is interacting with the REST API, the record updated by another user error you see in the classic UI won't typically occur. This is how we prevent conflicts in the core application.
In general, the last transaction synchronized wins. For example, if you changed the WORKTYPE to CM and I changed it to PM and you synchronized first (doesn't matter who made the change first offline) then it would be CM when you synchronized and changed to PM when I synchronized. We track explicitly the fields the user changed so if I didn't change the work type, we don't send the WORKTYPE field.
Supply Chain has a variety of business rules, however, that might prevent a transaction from going through. For example, if you closed the WO prior to my transactions being sent my transactions would fail. When errors occur on the Supply Chain server we present these to the user and they're provided the option of resending, discarding, or potentially try to change the record. We queue per record (IE workorder) so transactions for other records can still go through even if there are errors on the device.
In the case that another user closed the WO they would need to discard the changes because there is no way to fix it. In the case that the data was temporarily invalid but can be fixed, they can resend the change. For example, let's say you changed the WO to WAPPR instead of CLOSED. My labor transactions wouldn't be allowed in the current state. But if someone changes the WO back to APPR/INPRG I would be able to resend my changes.

<AccordionItem title='Understand parameters of Supply Chain Mobile spatial maps'>

**Installation of Supply Chain Spatial and an existing instance of ESRI ACRGIS**

With 8.7, the ability to utilize OpenMap (ESRI base map which is free) was added. You can't configure layers but if you're just looking for a map view in the new Graphite based applications it's possible. (Note - we don't support OpenMap in the classic Supply Chain UI)

<br/>

The points displayed on the map in Supply Chain Mobile require an attribute (plussgeojson) that requires Spatial today. It's possible to define this attribute and populate it with X/Y coordinates from the service address utilizing an automation script. This is an approach we're using for a Supply Chain Suite customer today. (Note - as of May 26, 2022, this isn't techncially supported but we're trying to get it supported.)

<AccordionItem title='Implement Single Sign On (SSO)'>

Single sign-on (SSO) is a method for authenticating users where a single set of credentials can be used to log into several different applications. This is especially useful in a corporate setting, when you want your employees to be able to access a variety of applications using their company credentials.  When customers purchase Supply Chain, they want end-users to maintain only one corporate log-in to manage the sign-on.


To implement a single sign-on, Supply Chain is configured to redirect logins to your company's identity provider server for user authentication. The username and password are maintained on your identity provider server, and there must always be a corresponding user in Supply Chain. Supply Chain provides a configurable synchronization process to pull the new Supply Chain users from your identity provider.


#### Beyond single sign-on (SSO) (Authorization)
After logging into Supply Chain, user privileges and data level security are authorized based on security groups configured in Supply Chain. Users are normally associated with appropriate security groups in Supply Chain by the Supply Chain administrator.

If you would like to handle mapping of users to security groups in your identity provider server, Supply Chain provides a synchronization process to pull this mapping but the security groups will still need to exist and be configured inside of Supply Chain first. The configuration of security groups must always be handled inside of Supply Chain as the security model is extremely robust and cannot be managed in an identify provider server.

If you would like additional security options, Supply Chain provides a set of REST APIs can you can call to perform specific security tasks.

* Do you currently have SSO?
* Do you plan to implement SSO?
* Will you use functionality OOB for this or will you need to create custom functionality? If yes, will need to work with implementer to accomplish this.

#### Supply Chain's two-step security process: Authentication and Authorization.

Authentication is the process of validating the identity of a user by providing proof that users are who they claim to be. There are different methods to authenticate users, and these methods share a common trait: authentication is always provided by a user ID and password.
After authentication has verified that a user is who they say they are, Authorization lets the user access various resources based on the identity of the user.  Note that Authentication is not concerned with granting or denying access to system resources, that is done via Authorization.
<br/>
You can authenticate users through:

Application server authentication can be used with an external authentication mechanism (LDAP).
Native authentication is provided in Supply Chain to authenticate users and verify their identity and security authorizations.


Authorization determines which modules and applications a user can access, which actions they can perform, and which data they can view, modify, and delete. Authorization is provided by membership in one or more Security Groups.

The Security Groups application is the building block for the security infrastructure. Administrators configure Security Groups, either independent or non- independent, to provide narrow access or broad access to Applications, Sites, Labor, and other settings, general ledger components and approval limits and tolerances.

The Security Group to which a user belongs controls the user's level of access and privileges within the system, defining the ROLE of the user. The system generates a user's security profile from all the groups in which a user is a member, using business rules to determine how the various security groups combine to build a virtual security profile. The security profile is like a fingerprint. It uniquely defines a user's access rights and privileges.

#### Two methods for implementation of single sign-on within Supply Chain Suite: LDAP and SAML
<br/>

##### LDAP

Initially for integration/synchronization with AD, one must decide who needs access to Supply Chain, and how filter just these users into the environment. For a new Supply Chain implementation, users need to exist in the directory maxadmin – default administrative user

**maxreg** – default user registration security user

**mxintadm** – default integration framework userWhen configuring Supply Chain for LDAP there are three parts.

Configure WebSphere to connect and authenticate against your directory server

Enable Supply Chain to authenticate logins with the Federated Repository, the user database maintained in WAS)

Configure Supply Chain to synchronize users from the Federated Repository configured in WebSphere which contains the users that are brought over from Active Directory.

For the application layer, authentication can be implemented using Supply Chain's proprietary user ID and password system or by implementation of LDAP-based authentication with a corporate LDAP system, SAML, etc. Authorization to application functionality is granted by the customer using Supply Chain's security profile models and security framework.

All management access is via secure protocol. All external and internal access is protected using firewalls with active IP restrictions, and all network activity is monitored and logged. Our services can be accessed only through a secure web connection.

128-bit encryption is used for UserID/Password storage.  Data in motion/transit uses over the network encryption supported via standard SSL (HTTPS) connections. When data is archived to tape it is encrypted. All data is encrypted as follows: Data at rest is encrypted using DB2's Native Encryption. Data in-flight is encrypted using IPSec. Attachments at rest are encrypted using LUKS.

<br/>

##### SAML
SAML is the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Its primary role in online security is that it enables you to access multiple web applications using one set of login credentials. It works by passing authentication information in a particular format between two parties, usually an identity provider (idP) and a web application.

<br/>

**Configuring SAML user authentication for use with Supply Chain Suite is a multistep process:**

1. Create SAML service provider information Your Supply Chain Suite server acts as service provider for the SAML identify provider (IdP). You need to provide a preferred service provider name and select a name identifier format, or use the defaults. The information is written to a service provider meta data file that you use to configure your SAML provider.

2. Register with the SAML provider. Configure your SAML IdP to recognize Supply Chain Suite. Use the downloaded SP file and follow the information for your SAML provider to complete this step.

3. From your SAML IdP, download the SAML IdP metadata XML file to Supply Chain Suite.

#### Notes on Microsoft Azure AD

Azure AD is not compatible with LDAP, and LDAP is required or the customer has to integrate themselves (such as utilizing the Graph API.)
