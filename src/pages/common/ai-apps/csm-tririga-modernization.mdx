## Scope

By its nature, Sustainability Software is designed for end users to deliver and optimize business processes. As such, the focus of modernization is not only on the movement of the software to an OpenShift platform and preparing it for the hybrid cloud, but it also involves modernizing the front end to better reflect modern interconnected applications, as well as the underlying data structures to facilitate sharing data among the individual applications. One of the main goals of modernization is to leverage a common platform and services that will allow offerings to look the same, work the same, operate and be managed the same with greater efficiencies. This enables IBM to deliver on the <Link to='/common/ai-appscsm-iss-overview#what-is-the-sustainability-pov'>Sustainability Software Point of View.</Link>

Modernizing IBM TRIRIGA is the process of taking customers from legacy IBM TRIRIGA (on-premises, SaaS and hosted), to IBM TRIRIGA Application Suite (TAS) running on Red Hat OpenShift.  There is an additional investment that the client will make in skills associated with Red Hat OpenShift.

For now, TRIRIGA’s functionality, use cases, and demonstration are equivalent to TAS. Only the license model and deployment architecture are changing. Most existing materials are still relevant and should continue to be used.

## Why should my customer modernize TRIRIGA?

Moving from the traditional IBM TRIRIGA to the IBM TRIRIGA Application Suite yields the following benefits:<br/>
(The first three are benefits of the Red Hat on OpenShift technology stack)<br/>

* Improves efficiency, reduces the cost of system infrastructure <br/>
* Simplifies deployment and management of enterprise systems <br/>
* Provides deployment flexibility (on-prem, cloud, hybrid-cloud) <br/>
* Uses simplified, more flexible software licensing <br/>
* Presents a uniform, improved user experience <br/>
* Offers easy expansion into additional capabilities with full-suite access via AppPoints <br/>

Expanding the use of IBM TRIRIGA into other functional areas to cover more than the original use case enables the customer to achieve a greater return on their investment in IBM TRIRIGA.  This would apply to both traditional TRIRIGA and TAS.

## Engage Client Phase

**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor <br/>

Before entering this phase, it is necessary to have discussed TRIRIGA modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.
The outcome of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in investigating the additional value that the organization will gain from TAS and Red Hat OpenShift capabilities and that the client sees the value in other aspects like integration, governance, future watsonx use cases, etc.  <br/>

**Technology Expert Labs offerings:** <br/>

* Build TAS Modernization – in planning, not available at this time
* [Expertise Connect/Expert Essential Services](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChTBdhh2f8jg8mHCbCTB8FfD683)

**IBM Consulting offerings:** <br/>

Build TAS Modernization – For the Implement and Accelerate phase, the IBM Consulting Delivery team will do **one** of the following: <br/>

* Quote and perform the services using IBM Consulting Delivery resources based on the plan delivered in the Technology Expert Labs Plan TAS Modernization engagement.  Note:  Due to limited delivery resources this team usually only accepts engagements greater than $1M.
* Quote and perform the services outsourced to an IBM Business Partner based on the plan delivered in the Technology Expert Labs Plan TAS Modernization engagement.  Note:  IBM Consulting will use this option if the client wants the agreement on IBM paper but the project will be under the minimum clip level for using IBM Delivery team resources.
* Recommend the client engage an IBM Business Partner directly to contract the services based on the plan delivered in the Technology Expert Labs Plan TAS Modernization engagement.  Note:  Unless the client prefers to have the services agreement on IBM paper, this is likely to be the least costly alternative. <br/>

<br/>

**Process and Assets:** <br/>

* If IBM Consulting will deliver or subcontract, the CSM should enter a services opportunity for IBM Consulting in ISC.  CSM should then contact the IBM Consulting Delivery team lead for TRIRIGA
Art Liem – Slack: @art   Email: aliem@us.ibm.com

* If an IBM Business Partner will deliver, the CSM should work with the IBM Brand Partner Specialist to refer the client to one or more IBM Business Partners to request a services quote based on the plan delivered in the Technology Expert Labs Plan TAS Modernization engagement.  See [Working with IBM Partners](https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/csm-partner-ecosystem/) <br/>

**Required inputs by CSM:** None; however, the CSM will want to maintain awareness for continued engagement with the client to monitor deployment progress, help as needed with any support case resolution delays or escalations, and confirm use case live in production for updating the project scorecard milestone in Gainsight.
