## Overview
As a CSM, your focus is to guide your client in the adoption of the Maximo Application Suite (MAS) entitlement, from the initial deployment through expansion opportunities. Starting with the SRE’s provisioning and onboarding, you’ll monitor the activities through the deployment stage as the client moves into production. Beyond this initial go-live, you will work with the client to expand their product usage into additional modules, locations, business units, users, asset/work types or otherwise increase the AppPoint usage.

You can learn more about MAS on the <Link to='/common/ai-apps/csm-ai-maximo'>Maximo Application Suite Playbook page</Link>.

### CSM Scorecard Milestones

SaaS milestones for the CSM Scorecard are based on usage. To progress from Planning to Deploying to Deployed, see <Link to='/common/saas-growth/#sustainability-software-saas-milestones-based-on-usage'>Sustainability software milestones based on usage</Link>.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:** The following usage-based milestones are not automated in Gainsight; the Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status. Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard.

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SRE | An environment exists.  No Customer access. <br/><br/> Provisioning takes an average of 10 days, for both Prod and Non-Prod Environments. <br/><br/> But if it's a MAS SaaS Premium Dedicated customer requesting a separate cluster, then it takes an additional 20 days for provisioning. Total time: 10 + 20 = 30days| After the Order is placed, it will be processed by Order Management.  Sometimes there are concerns with the Order, such as credit checks.  The Sales Representative will be deeply engaged with solving these issues, and progress it to Provisioning.<br/><br/>**Sizing and planning**<br/> Identifying the Use Case that the customer wants to address with MAS should have been performed before the sale. The number of users and modules to be used should have already determined the configuration of the environment pre-sales, before the environment was provisioned.<br/><br/>Read through the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCpMhcBhDGDbH8qB88JVJF2T8G6j' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Maximo Application Suite License Overview Guide for Clients</a> or the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCWMFHfF2pPXT8cQ8BJP736G49Qj' rel='noreferrer noopener'>New MAS SaaS Pricing Tiers</a> document for an understanding of MAS AppPoints.<br/><br/>The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChB2R4P39Pm38TVX863Mp7bmJDV' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Maximo Application Suite AppPoint Calculator</a> is what is used to convert Maximo licenses to MAS AppPoints.

| For MAS SaaS premium customers, what is the RTO/RPO if they buy enhanced DR? | <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas/saas?topic=editions-premium' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>MAS SaaS Premium Details</a>  - Current RTO/RPO is 72/24. When customers buy enhanced DR, they get an RTO of 6 hours and an RPO of 15 minutes, however, it is only available to clients who purchase Premium Edition with the non-shared cluster deployment option. They must purchase additional AppPoints to get Enhanced DR. The quantity of additional AppPoints varies with the size of the base deployment. Essentially, we have to stand up a second full production instance in a separate AWS data center. The larger the production instance, the more it costs to replicate it. |
