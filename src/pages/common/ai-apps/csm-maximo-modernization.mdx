## What is included in Maximo Modernization?

Maximo Modernization consists of the actions that can be taken to establish our Customer’s continued success (and renewal) through our next generation of products in the Maximo Application Suite, and get the Customer to use OpenShift in some way.

<br/><br/>

### Journey Maps

There are three Journey Maps that we can consider to be Modernization, as they result in the Customer using the next generation of the products, and being on a OpenShift environment:

<br/><br/>

<AnchorLinks small>
<AnchorLink>EAM to MAS Migration</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Maximo Mobile Implementation</AnchorLink>
<AnchorLink>Maximo Visual Inspection Implementation</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

(Refer to the IBM Maximo Application Suite page for other areas of Expansion.)

### Implementation methods

These can be accomplished in a number of Implementation Methods.  In no particular order, the customer can:
- do it themselves
- use Technology Expert Labs
- use a IBM Partner
- use IBM Consulting

General information about these Implementation Methods, such as the overall needs or how to engage in general, can be found on the IBM Maximo Application Suite.  Information specific to these

These Journey Maps will help CSMs run through the steps, taking into consideration the Implementation Approach that is in place, or that might need to be recommended.

  <AccordionItem title="Understanding the EAM to MAS Migration">

<InlineNotification>

This step outlines how a CSM can inform themselves on the EAM to MAS Migration.  We've provided what the Migration is, the Carrots and the Sticks for the Customer to Migrate.  The outcome of this step is to be ready to prepare for a conversation with the Customer about Migration.

<br/>

**IBM:** Customer Success Manager, Brand Technical Seller, Account Technical Specialist

**Customer:** None at this time.

</InlineNotification>

### What is the EAM to MAS Migration?

First, a few points for context:

- EAM is short for Enterprise Asset Management, and if often used to refer to Maximo version 7
- MAS is short for Maximo Application Suite, the newest version of IBM's EAM AND <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC7FPMd7RBCcMGFHcPT9GpWMPPGV">Asset Performanance Management (APM)</a> software
- MAS is licensed through AppPoints.  This migration plan assumes that the upgrade sale of AppPoints has already been completed, so they have access to MAS, but the customer is stil running EAM.
- For additional high level context, this  <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/asset-facilities/viewdocument/evolve-your-asset-management-with-t?CommunityKey=3d7261ae-48f7-481d-b675-a40eb407e0fd&tab=librarydocuments">Journey Infographic</a> is how we're positioning the migration with our Customers.

<br/>

The process involves upgrading the customer's EAM environment to MAS, which would include moving the customer's data from the current EAM compliant infrastructure to the MAS OpenShift based infrastructure, testing for any issues with the new MAS software in the customer's business procedures, and enabling the end users with information on the new user interface.

### Why should a customer migrate from EAM to MAS?

**The Carrots**

Maximo Application Suite 8.11 includes the following enhancements above and beyond EAM:
- Enterprise Asset Management - AI-infused technologies that drive efficiencies that reduce costs
  - IBM Maximo Manage adds new capabilities to the Scheduler and Operational Manager dashboards.
  -	IBM Maximo IT is a new add-on that empowers seamless, IT Service Management, IT Asset Management, and IT/OT collaboration across the enterprise.
  - IBM Maximo Optimizer adds model enhancements to enable new Dispatching dashboard available as part of the IBM Maximo Scheduler.
  - IBM Maximo Mobile is a re-imagined Mobile experience.
  - Enhanced login capabilities that provide options for multiple login routes, default login paths, and seamless login using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity provider.
  - A range of security and user administration enhancements to assist clients deploying Maximo Application Suite in highly regulated environments.
  - Asset Reliability Strategies Library to improve asset reliability.  IBM Maximo Reliability Strategies is a new add-on that enables the creation of reliability centered maintenance strategies through a database of industrial content including equipment types, failure mechanisms, and maintenance tasks built by domain and industry experts.
- Asset Performance Management - AI-infused technologies that reduce asset failures and reduce inspection costs, while improving the frequency & accuracy
  - IBM Maximo Predict adds enhancements for users who work with Watson Studio projects and SPSS® models and a foundation for condition-based maintenance
  - IBM Maximo Monitor adds the capability for integrating with widely used industrial data sources including devices, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and Open Platform Communications (OPC) servers using a comprehensive catalogue of ready-to-use connectors. Device data is automatically transformed into a standardized data model.
  - Access to partner technologies ecosystem that drives time to value.
- Computer Vision Inspections
  -	IBM Maximo Visual Inspection adds intelligent grouping of image datasets, object storage support, anomaly detection models optimized based on inferencing hardware, and seamless upgrades on Maximo Visual Inspection Edge.
- Delivered SaaS First

You can dive deeper into the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="hhttps://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCTV2VhmRX8hP8qD4jJj89P8WFR3">What's new with Upgrade to MAS</a> presentation.  The deck isn't customer-ready, but might have some content that would resonate with your customer.

<br/>

Additionally, MAS runs on RedHat OpenShift (RHOS), which provides a number of operational benefits to the customer, including:

- Portability - containers encapsulate an application and all its dependencies, making it easy to run the same containerized application on different environments, such as development, testing, and production. This reduces compatibility issues and streamlines deployment.
- Scalability/auto-scaling -designed to be lightweight and can be rapidly scaled up or down to meet changing workload demands. Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes make it easy to manage and automate the scaling of containerized applications.
- Security - enhance security through isolation and image scanning tools. They also make it easier to patch and update applications, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.
- Dependency management - all dependencies within the container image, reducing the likelihood of conflicts and ensuring that the application runs with the required libraries and components.
- CI/CD Enablement - fit well into DevOps and CI/CD pipelines. Easier to automate testing, deployment, and updates, leading to faster development cycles and improved collaboration between development and operations teams.
- _RHOS Key Features_
  - Cloud agnostic - not tied to a specific cloud provider or platform. You can run containers on various cloud services or on-premises infrastructure, offering flexibility in choosing where and how to deploy your applications.
  - Programming language agnostic (each container can run its own code)
  - Ease of updating/upgrading components with less downtime than monolithic applications
  - Ability to decouple services into microservices - Microservices are more flexible and easier to manage than a monolithic application.
  - Ability to move to managed services and/or pay-as-you-go model.
  - Platform consistency
  - Total resource capacity control
  - Nimble deployment

<br/>

Is the customer is not interested in running RHOS, and would rather consume the software as a service, this <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC42JWgRq33Dc8mFCc8BVX6MFWQB">MAS SaaS Sales Update from 2 Aug 2023</a> provides a good outline of the MAS SaaS Editions summarized below.

<br/>

**The Sticks**

-	Support for EAM will be coming to an end.  Per IBM policy, once a Customer purchases AppPoints, they have 12 months to move from EAM to MAS.  Given the scale of this change for IBM and our Customers, IBM will be waiving that requirement, but all customers that have purchased AppPoints, and therefore have dual entitlement to EAM and MAS, must move to MAS before April 2027.
    Click <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6570953?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=AMPWW&utm_term=30BH6&utm_id=Infographic-Ensuring-continued-support" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>HERE</a> to review End of Support details.

  - Customers who have moved to AppPoints will not be eligile for the Extended or Sustained support after April 2027.

### Is the EAM to MAS Migration right for my Customer?

Customers who are currently on Maximo EAM 7.6.1.3 are in a good position to move to MAS.

The EAM to MAS Migration is applicable for customers who have purchased some EAM product in the past (Maximo SaaS Flex, Perpetual licenses, or some other hosted solution for which they own the entitlement), and have now upgraded to AppPoints, but are currently still running Maximo 7.x or prior.

![MAS Deployment options](../images/MAS_deployment_options.png)   <br/>

### What resources are availible to make a plan with the customer?

If the customer already has a plan, you might want to use that as your starting point. If not, the template and examples below have been used in several accounts.  It is not expected that any client will need to do all of the steps, and it is likely that a client will have some unique activities (team integrations, budgets, approvals, additional testing, etc.) they want to add.  All the durations are specific to the client, depending on their skills, access to support staff, and amount of overhead in their processes. You can look at the examples to see how others have done it. Please make sure that if  you reuse an example, you first clean all the client references.

Engage BVA team member Ashok Kumar (kumaras@ibm.com) to explore the possibility of arriving at a use case ROI by moving to MAS suite. This could be only for those Big ACV customers who are resistant to migrating on time or have questions on ROI for their investment in MAS.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Understanding Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI)">

<InlineNotification>

This step outlines how a CSM can inform themselves on the MVI.  We've provided what MVI is, and some of the ways it is being used.  The outcome of this step is to be ready to prepare for a conversation with the Customer about MVI.

<br/>

**IBM:** Customer Success Manager, Brand Technical Seller, Account Technical Specialist

<br/>

**Customer:** None at this time.

</InlineNotification>

### What is MVI?

Maximo® Visual Inspection makes computer vision with deep learning accessible to business users by providing an intuitive tool set that empowers subject matter experts to label, train, and deploy deep learning vision models, without coding or data science expertise.  The solution includes the most popular deep learning frameworks, and it is built for easy and rapid deployment.

<br/>

The implementation process involves obtaining a MVI environment through one of a number of ways, establisghing the use cases to be explored, and then training the system for the initial inferencing.

### Why should a customer use MVI?

- Accelerate defect detection
  - Continuously improve quality control through real-time end-to-end defect detection anywhere on the production line, support root cause analysis and boost manufacturing workflows.
- Gain the flexibility to train and deploy anywhere
  - Simplify the process of gathering and labeling data sets, training models, and deploying those AI models at the edge.
- Boost uptime with 24/7 real-time monitoring
  -Automate data labeling for deep-learning models to quickly spot and stop issues, alerting the right resource to inspect, diagnose and rectify any issue, anywhere.
- Enable any subject matter expert (SME)
  - Provide SMEs the tools to codify their knowledge through an AI-powered visual inspection system that is fast and easy to create.
- Increase worker safety through visual inspection software
  - Monitor and enforce inspection tasks and regulations for safety to protect workers from hazardous environments and dangerous conditions.

### Is MVI right for my Customer?

This <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChfWGbBW7bGJ84RVP2W4mh9TJfd">Maximo Visual Inspection Seller One Pager</a> provides a framework for evaluating if MVI is right for your customer.

Specific qualification criteria to consider:

- Is the primary use case focused on asset inspection and equipment reliability?
- Do assets require frequent inspections, are in hard-to-access or dangerous
locations, where up-time, safety,and performance are critical to business operations, resiliency, and cost management?

### What's next?

Before Engaging the Customer, it is necessary to have discussed the topic of MVI with the Brand Technical Seller and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan, or any aspects of the migration that has been discussed during the sales process.
