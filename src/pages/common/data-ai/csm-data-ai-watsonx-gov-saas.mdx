### CSM Scorecard Milestones based on usage

SaaS milestones for the CSM Scorecard are based on usage. To progress from Planning to Deploying to Deployed, see <Link to='/common/saas-growth/#data-and-ai-saas-milestones-based-on-usage'>Data and AI milestones based on usage</Link>.

<InlineNotification>

**Note: the usage-based milestones are not automated in Gainsight; the Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status. Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard.**

Refer to the steps in the <Link to='/common/acceleration-plays/watsonx-gov-play'>watsonx.gov Acceleration Play</Link>. that covers sizing to determine what will need to be provisioned. <br/><br/> **Provisioning the service** <br/>Use the <a href='https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=governing-ai-assets'>Getting Started</a> section of the watsonx.gov Documentation along with the <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/vt5bhdeh8pq65j20wlez3f0b5ias0m0p' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>CS IBM Cloud onboarding guide</a> to guide your customer through the process of provisioning the watsonx.gov service. <br/><br/> A <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/clowrj2uc2g5cnjg2ycas9wm7j95rfep" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Welcome Email Template</a> is available and can be used to introduce yourself to your client and provide links to the product documentation, how to raise a support ticket, how to join the watsonx Community and enablement material. |
