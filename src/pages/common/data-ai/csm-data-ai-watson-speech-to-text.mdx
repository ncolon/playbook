## What is IBM Watson Language Services and what does it do? <br/>
IBM Watson Language Services is made up of IBM Watson Speech to Text and IBM Watson Text to Speech Cloud APIs (that can run on any cloud as part of Cloud Pak for Data).<br/><br/>
**IBM Watson Speech to Text** enables fast and accurate speech transcription in multiple languages for a variety of use cases, including customer self-service, agent assistance, speech analytics, and more.<br/>
**IBM Watson Text to Speech** enables the conversion of written text into natural-sounding audio in a variety of languages and voices within an existing application or within watsonx Assistant.<br/>

## What are the pain points that IBM Watson Language Services addresses?

**Pain Point: ** Need to recognize speech to enable applications for voice conversation, transcription and analytics<br/>
**Pain Point: ** Need to be able to recognize unique business terminology, acronyms, product names and jargon<br/>
**Pain Point: ** Need to filter words, inappropriate content, or profanities <br/>
**Pain Point: ** Need to be able to synthesize speech with expressive, and/or custom voices <br/>
**Pain Point: ** Need customers to feel like they are not talking to a robot. For instance, need to be able to pronounce unusual words <br/>

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

IBM Watson Language Services follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChqW8MbD6Pjc8CF9GRcPHQDVX6G#/?anchorId=15043682-95cf-4c83-9f3c-9cbeced8d14f' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>demonstrations</a> in Seismic can be used to help show the customer how IBM Watson Language Services can be used to address the problem areas<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (Proof of Experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering and CSM can work together to connect IBM Watson Language Services to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs, Business Partners and IBM Consulting can take ownership of an implementation project and guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

CSM Guang Ming Zhang assisted <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2022-csm-spotlight/bmw-brilliance' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>BMW Brilliance</a> implement watsonx Assistant and Watson Discovery to improve customer service. The CSM worked with the customer on planning, such as which department to start with, when to start integrating Watson Discovery, etc.

## How do I expand and grow IBM Watson Language Services usage?

Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment. From there, the positioning of additional services driven by new use cases will validate the need for additional compute or CP4D services.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identfy and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. <br/>
Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. <br/>
If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders: Dave Mulley or Campbell Robertson for assistance. <br/>
You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement)
