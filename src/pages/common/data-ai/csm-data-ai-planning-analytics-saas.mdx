### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| SRE |  Planning Analytics SaaS instance provisioned and customer has access. | The Planning Analytics SaaS instance is provisioned and managed by the IBM SRE team. The client will be required to create an <a href='https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBMid account</a>. |

### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| IBM SRE and CSM | Customer has validated access to their Planning Analytics SaaS instance and has added users. | After the Planning Analytics SaaS instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the welcome email. <br/><br/> **Getting started** <br/> Use the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/planning-analytics/2.0.0?topic=cloud-planning-analytics-account-system-information" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>product documentation</a> and <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/planning/learning" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Getting Started Guide</a> to add users to the environment. <br/><br/> **Nurture opportunities**<br/> After the Product Led Growth interface in Gainsight is configured later in 2024, you will be able to track the activities that the customer is performing in Planning Analytics.
