## Engagement context for the upgrade

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title='Client upgrade without IBM assistance'>

### Client upgrade without IBM assistance 

In this scenario, the customer wants to perform the upgrade without any involvement from IBM/external services support. In this case, the assumption is that the customer has the resources, expertise, and experience to upgrade successfully suitable to the complexity of their OCP+CP4D environment. In this case the CSM's role is to offer to: <br/>

* Take the customer through the available upgrade documentation to ensure they have all the available information they need for their planning, as well as to review with the customer how to engage IBM support in the event they run into issues. <br/>

* Review the customer's upgrade plan to identify gaps and/or risks, answer outstanding questions answered, <br/>

* Hold regular checkpoints with them throughout the upgrade project <br/>


**CSM action:** Verify Client Timeline, Explain Support Process, Review Upgrade Steps, Review Documentation with Client, Review all components affected by upgrade (hardware & software), Identify Individuals Involved with upgrade, Ensure version compatibility of hardware/storage/software


If the client wants to upgrade themselves and in the CSMs opinion is not equipped to do so successfully, what should the CSM do?


The CSM should engage the overall IBM team to ensure that all decision-makers at the client acknowledge the skills required to perform a OpenShift and CP4D upgrade. All the CSM can do is prepare the client and raise concerns to the client's organization on risks.


The CSM should work with their Technology Expert Labs Service Seller to <a href='https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/7197619/Solution-Engineering-Request-Form' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>request a Solution Engineer </a> to engage in the scoping and planning discussions with the client. 

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='IBM Technology Expert Labs (TEL) hands-off keyboard consultation with client'>

### IBM Technology Expert Labs (TEL) hands-off keyboard consultation with the client

In this scenario, the customer wants to perform the upgrade themselves but wants to collaborate with IBM for the planning and execution oversight. In this scenario, the assumption is that the client has the resources and sufficient expertise to upgrade successfully but wants to leverage IBM's experience to ensure they plan accordingly as well as have IBM present while they execute the upgrade. In this case the CSM's role is to<br/>


* Understand how much assistance the customer wants with the planning (have IBM review their plan [for free] vs have IBM assess their environment and provide a plan as well as an execution runbook [pay IBM to provide the plan & runbook] and propose/coordinate the IBM resources accordingly, <br/>

* Understand for the execution of the upgrade how present they want IBM to be and which skills they want present, and propose/coordinate the IBM resources accordingly,<br/>

* Project manage the IBM resource participation and overall engagement model with the customer.<br/>


**CSM action:** Verify Client Timeline, Explain Support Process, Review Upgrade Steps, Review Documentation with Client, Review all components affected by upgrade (hardware & software), Identify Individuals Involved with upgrade, Ensure version compatibility of hardware/storage/software.
Provide or find help to instruct the client on how to proceed.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='IBM Support SWAT Team upgrades'>

### IBM Support SWAT Team upgrades


In this scenario, the client wants IBM to do the upgrade for them but refuses to pay for services to do so. The CSMs role in this scenario is to assess the appropriateness of the customer's ask and set the customer's expectations appropriately. For example, before even considering free SWAT team involvement, for simple upgrades, consider how co-participation with them is a better option. For more complex upgrades that meet the SWAT team's engagement criteria, the customer's expectations on timeframe need to be clearly set given free SWAT team availability. If the free SWAT team is the path taken, the **CSM's role** is to: <br/>

*  Engage the SWAT team on behalf of the customer, <br/>

* Participate in the upgrade project status reviews between the customer and the SWAT team, <br/>

* Oversee the effective use of IBM support during the engagement if/when needed, <br/>

* Act as the customer's first point of escalation should there be issues with the upgrade project meeting expectations.


Review the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cloud-pak-for-data-client-experience/services/cp4d-upgrades' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SWAT Team submission process</a> to understand the process. There will be a lead time in scheduling so set clients expectations correctly.


**CSM action:** Offer Expert Labs first, if the client refuses (different than the client preferring not to pay) then CP4D Upgrade SWAT Team would be the suggested route.

### Modernization Conversations
While we have largely achieved functional parity withÂ **IBM InfoSphereÂ® Information Governance Catalog (IGC) and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA)**Â with the release of IKC on Cloud Pak for Data 4.8, CSMs and Account Teams should be very deliberate inÂ how and whenÂ to have these conversations with clients.Â <br/><br/>

**Whatâs the risk?** <br/>
In addition to the functional gaps we closed with Cloud Pak for Data 4.7, we also introduced a set of semi-automated migration tools to assist clients who deployed the XMETA-based components that were part of IKC. These tools help clients get fromÂ older versions of IKC to IKC Â 4.7,Â but they doÂ not support the semi-automated migration from IGC/IA to IKC. These tools have been enhanced throughout 2H23 and will support IGC/IA migration to Cloud Pak for Data with the release of 4.8. <br/><br/>

**Is Information Server reaching end of life?** <br/>
No. While it's true our investment in data movement, transformation and governance is focused on IKC and IKC on Cloud Pak for Data, there are noÂ imminent plans to end support for Information Server. If it's working for clients, they can continue to run this environment and be confident they will continue to receive support. <br/><br/>

**What about this Free Migration Assessment?** <br/>
It's true! Expert Labs has developed a free migration assessment. The data collection part of the assessment can be useful to help plan for the eventual migration <br/><br/>

**So what should I do?** <br/>
- Engage with your client now.Â  Understand their current IGC deployment and what problems or upcoming use cases they need to address.
- Plan an account strategy for 1H24.Â  Where are they going?Â  What unmet needs do they currently have?Â  Are the blind spots in their data estate they want to address?
- Position IKC to addressÂ newÂ use cases.Â  Don't start with a modernization play.Â  Start with a strategy to deploy IKC to address the new use cases.Â  Start small.
- Plan the modernization. After successfully deploying that first IKC use case, what's next?Â  Are there other gaps or is it time to plan a modernization discussion?

### Why should a customer modernize?
IBM Cloud Pak for Data and IBM Knowledge Catalog provides customers with the next generation of IBM InfoSphereÂ® Information Governance Catalog (IGC) and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA) and includes the following benefits:
- *Consume and extract value from more data* â IKCâs data protection enabled multi-catalog approach improves the ability to organize and distribute data across the organization
- *Control data risk and ensure data quality* â IKCâs data protection rules, SLA rules, and Next Gen Data Quality ensure the safety and quality of data for improved use in Analytics and BI

### How complex is modernization?
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. **The purpose of the FREE Technology Expert Labs Assessment is to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan**. The <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGmpRf8dgCpP8fHC6TMmq9mXChG">Legacy Migration Sales Guide</a> has a summary of the migration limitations of the semi-automated tooling and the comparisons of functionality between IGC and IKC.  

Note: Customers will first need to upgrade to the latest IGC version, before modernizing to IKC.

Before entering this phase it is necessary to discuss the topic of IKC modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.

This phase covers the steps necessary to have the first conversation with the customer about IKC modernization (**Executive level meeting**). We've provided a sample *Compelling Reason to Act* which is generic and applicable to most IGC customers as well as a deck from Product Management that goes into more depth on the value of modernization from IBM InfoSphereÂ® Information Governance Catalog (IGC) and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA) and moving them to IBM Knowledge Catalog running on Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShiftn.
