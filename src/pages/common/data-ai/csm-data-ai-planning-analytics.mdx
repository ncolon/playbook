## What is IBM Planning Analytics and what does it do? <br/>
IBM Planning Analytics with Watson: Plan for anything, be ready for everything. Most likely, you are sitting on a data gold mine. But you are not realizing its value because you rely on manual, disconnected, and error-prone processes. IBM Planning Analytics with Watson allows you to unify and streamline planning, budgeting and forecasting across every part of your organization to deliver faster, more agile plans that can pivot in real-time to address changing market demands. This AI-powered planning solution allows you to automate key processes, augment human intelligence and utilize predictive capabilities to create more accurate, consistent, and timely forecasts, without requiring a data scientist. With built-in data analytics, you can uncover deep insights without having to export data to other tools. And when customer demands or market conditions change, you can adjust plans easily with the click of a button – so your team can stay out of the weeds and focused on the work that matters, with high performance at scale.<br/><br/>
You can:<br/>
-- Support every phase of your analytics journey. IBM delivers the only comprehensive suite of solutions that supports every stage of your journey — from identifying key drivers and building a plan to predicting future outcomes and monitoring results.<br/>
-- Boost adoption with a familiar interface. Transcend the limitations of spreadsheets and drive up adoption with IBM’s embedded Excel interface, which lets users retain the familiar functionality while adding robust capabilities to help deliver more reliable results.<br/>
-- Deploy anywhere. The ultimate in agility and collaboration: deploy on-premises, on cloud or on IBM Cloud Pak for Data, with the same robust experience throughout. Access your data, analyze it, and act on it from anywhere, at any time.<br/>

Automate resource allocation and territory planning to get a competitive advantage and increase market share <br/>
**Pain Point: HR Processes: ** Automate and streamline HR management processes–employment, salary, bonuses, headcounts, and benefits planning – all in one platform. Develop accurate AI-guided workforce plans and forecasts based on changes in staffing, location, return to work, remuneration, retention, churn rates and more. <br/>
**Pain Point: Marketing program tracking and analysis: ** Plan, track and analyze marketing programs in real-time to understand performance metrics against benchmarks and make ongoing adjustments. Create more effective marketing plans and forecasts that drive higher marketing ROI. <br/><br/>

The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCXPhHhRVcCjc8FCmfXRfcMVmqDB' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Conversation Guide</a> addresses the differentiators and benefits of Planning Analytics

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

IBM Planning Analytics follows the traditional model of <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCCbm8b4VcT9fG9FcMd9BGMTPRR3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>demonstrations</a> in Seismic can be used to help show the customer how IBM Planning Analytics can be used to address the problem areas<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering and CSM can work together to connect IBM Planning Analytics to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs, Business Partners and IBM Consulting can take ownership of an implementation project and guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What do CSM-driven deployments look like?

CSM Khoi Phan guided <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2022-csm-spotlight/credit-agricole' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Crédit Agricole</a> through a project to standardize IT costs and have their information in a unique format on an unique platform. They also wanted to ensure an accurate IT budget forecast, and reduce time to build the budget. Finally, Crédit Agricole top management needed to have a consolidated and accurate view of IT costs

## How do I expand and grow IBM Planning Analytics usage?

Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment. From there, the positioning of additional services driven by new use cases will validate the need for additional compute or CP4D services.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. <br/>
Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. <br/>
If you need assistance running a workshop reach out to the Practice Leaders: Dave Mulley or Campbell Robertson for assistance. <br/>
You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement)
