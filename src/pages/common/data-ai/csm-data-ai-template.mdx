## What is Cloud Pak for Data ? <br/>
**IBM Cloud Pak for Data** is an Enterprise Data Platform to fully automate Data Management and Analysis. It ingests all observability metrics, traces every request and profiles every process, correlating and analyzing the data so DevOps teams can optimize their application performance, especially microservices and cloud-native applications, and accelerate pipelines. The automated monitoring, comprehensive data model and powerful semantics, coupled with deep analytics, gives stakeholders the actionable insights needed to keep services running at optimum levels.

## What are the pain points that Instana addresses?

"**Monitoring** tells you what is wrong, **observability** tells you why" <br/> <br/>
The key pain points that Instana addresses are related to the complexity of trying to resolve incidents in dynamic, modern environments. <br/><br/>
Traditional monitoring tools may have been fine in legacy, static environments, but they don't work as well with the Cloud and micro-service/container/cloud-native applications: <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Lack of end-to-end observability from mobile to the mainframe <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **IT teams are unable to rapidly detect and resolve issues in complex heterogeneous runtime technologies and target environments ranging from legacy systems of record to virtual machines to containers that could be distributed across multiple clouds <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to deliver reliable application response time to end users <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **IT teams spend too much time and energy on expensive monitoring tools that provide limited insight and are flood with events and logs with no way to filter or eliminate noise <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to keep up with the rapid growth of cloud-native environments <br/><br/>
**Key:** *Look for the pain that the IT teams are feeling with trying to run their hybrid environments that have outgrown their legacy monitoring tools.*<br/><br/>
The key here is that monitoring tells you what is wrong, observability tells you why. As businesses modernize, the complexity of the implementations increase beyond the capabilities of humans to be able to monitor them in a traditional, reactive way.<br/><br/>
Instana uses real-time insights and machine learning to find, alert and remediate production issues, identify bottlenecks and anomalies and filter noise reducing adminstrative overhead and improving "Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR).




## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Instana follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above along with the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC26J44RW4T6M84DmhG62hfT3PhB' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>AIOps Acceleration Workshop</a> or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://play-with.instana.io/#/home' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Click-through demo</a> has a script that can be used to quickly demonstrate the capabilities of Instana to the customer<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, Instana TAM and CSM can work together to connect Instana to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs can take ownership of an implementation project using their <a href='https://soda.dal1a.ciocloud.nonprod.intranet.ibm.com/show/3618' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>pre-packaged offerings.</a> Instana TAM and CSM can help guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>


## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

Loblaws wanted to be able to monitor and alert on the performance of MQ, ACE, Liberty and DataPower running on OpenShift in IBM Cloud. The CSM worked with Technology Expert Labs, Instana TAM and IBM Consulting to deploy two Instana Server instances and OpenShift sensors in each OpenShift cluster as well as configure alerts and performance dashboards.

## How do I expand and grow Instana usage?

Instana is licensed by the number of <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCR8CfVqV6RX88fGmd4MX7WCHDX3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Managed Virtual Servers</a>. Expansion for Instana is as simple as adding more Virtual Servers to the Instana environment.
<br/>The proven Instana model is to land and expand by starting with a single application or line of business, prove value and the expand to other applications and business units. The "value" of Instana is easily quantifiable by looking at the following:

  * Reduction in MTTD and MTTR
  * Improved application response time and production availability
  * Improved deployment frequency

Quantifiable reductions and improvements are key to expansion. Collect as-is data points before deployment and 30, 60 and 90 days later compare the new results. The numbers will speak for themselves.



## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their modernization journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above. Be aware of the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCP6J3WQf9qdmG7M7Mp9DVXd3BVV' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>competition</a> and how to address the "we use Dynatrace", "we use AppDynamics" response.<br/><br/>
If you need to start from scratch with the overall "Automation" brand of products with your customer, then there is an <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/automation-innovation-workshop' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Automation Innovation Workshop</a> (free) that can be used when trying to generate interest, sponsors and use cases that is available to Sales teams and CSMs.<br/>

### Special notes

Instana had Customer Success Managers before acquisition, however, that role has been sunset and there may be confusion with legacy Instana customers as to the role that the IBM CSM plays.

Instana still does have Technical Account Managers (TAM) that have some overlap with the role of the IBM CSM. If your customers also has an Instana TAM, it is recommended that you work together to deploy and grow the Instana footprint.

## Frequently asked questions

* **Is Instana a Cloud Pak or part of Cloud Pak for Watson AI Ops?**

No. Instana is a standalone product with unique part numbers.

* **As an IBM CSM, do I get credit for deploying Instana entitlements in Gainsight?**

Absolutely! Instana is one of the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/the-practice/csm-covered-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Growth offerings that IBM CSMs cover</a>.

* **Instana Professional Services are already working with my customer to deploy the entitlements, what do I need to do as an IBM CSM?**

Connect with the Instana team and introduce yourself. You will want to stay connected and report the status of the deployment in Gainsight.
