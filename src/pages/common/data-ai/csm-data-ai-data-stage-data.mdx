## What is DataStage and what does it do?
IBM DataStage on IBM Cloud Pak for Data is a modernized data integration solution to collect and deliver trusted data anywhere, at any scale and complexity, on and across multicloud and hybrid cloud environments. Save on data movement costs by bringing a best-in-breed parallel engine to where your data is. Increase the productivity of your business and IT users through automated job design and out-of-the-box, native integration with cloud data lakes, real-time data sources, relational databases, big data, and NoSQL data stores.<br/>

* Design once, run anywhere paradigm allows you to bring data integration to where your data resides.
A best-in-breed parallel engine processes substantial data volumes, and built-in workload balancing supports multicloud scalability and elasticity.
* The DataStage service uses Cloud Pak for Data platform connections and integration points, with services like Data Virtualization, to simplify the process of connecting to and accessing your data.<br/>
With a fully cloud-native architecture, DataStage can dynamically scale workloads and optimize for large data sets. With a few steps, you can deploy IBM DataStage on Cloud Pak for Data in your AWS infrastructure to facilitate cloud-to-cloud, ground-to-cloud, or cloud-to-on-premises tasks.

Some Key Benefits  from the [Data Stage Solution Brief](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCXgpTCPD6CmH84QFppd2hb3WDBB)

* 50% lower cost of operations through simpler operations and maintenance.
* 30% savings on workload execution time due to elastic scaling and balancing.
* 50% or more reduction in development costs when running on multiple cloud environments thanks to the design once and run anywhere feature.
* 87% savings in development cost when using visual and ML-assisted design, as compared to hand coding.
* Existing customers can retain existing investments in skills and assets and save millions of dollars in license cost savings by eliminating the need to purchase Windows/Citrix thick client licenses.

### What pain points does DataStage address?

Data Integration and Quality are at the heart of your DataOps value chain:<br/>
* Provides flexibility on how to integrate your data and at what latency<br/>
* Provides high scalability across a variety and volume of data<br/>
* Provides built-in capabilities for data quality, governance and AI<br/>

### DataStage modernization

DataStage modernization is the process of taking customers from IBM Infosphere DataStage, IBM Infosphere QualityStage or IBM Information Server and moving them to DataStage NextGen running on Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShift. To run DataStage NextGen, the customer needs to have licenses to either DataStage Cartridge or Information Server Cartridge.

### Identify phase

#### Common practices

Before you start to work with the customer, you will need to learn about the customer, their industry, what was sold, and who you might work with.

| Practice | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <Link to='/onboard/understand-client-it-landscape/'>Learn about the customer</Link> | Before you get started, you need to learn about your customer and their business. |
| <Link to='/onboard/learn-partner/'>Learn about the partner</Link> | If your customer is working with a partner, you need to learn about the partner and their relationship with IBM and the customer. |
| <Link to='/onboard/understand-deal/'>Understand the deal</Link> | Learn where to find information related to how the product was sold to the customer. |
| <Link to='/deploy/identify/'>Identify</Link> | Understand what the customer will need to be successful. |

You will need to understand if the customer is an existing DataStage customer who needs to focus on modernization or if this is new to DataStage.

#### Product-specific practices

| Led by | Outcome | Assets & Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Prioritized use case | **There isn't a current use case, where do I start?** <br/> - Focus on modernization discussions <br/> - Planned data integration projects <br/> - DataOps-led initiatives <br/> Run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs.  Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. <br/> If you need assistance running a workshop, contact Practice Leader: Campbell Robertson.  You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Expert Labs (Paid Engagement). <br/><br/> The customer is an existing DataStage customer who should modernize to CPD or DataStage Anywhere. <br/><br/> The customer is new to DataStage and needs to drive to an initial adoption use case.

#### Why should a customer modernize?
DataStage NextGen on Cloud Pak for Data provides customers with the next generation of DataStage and includes the following benefits:
- Redesigned GUI using modern, web-based canvases that do not require re-training of client developers.
- Additional data integrations to help virtualize, replicate, stream, and prepare data before or after the ETL job is completed in DataStage.
- Micro-services-based architecture & containerized, optimized for hybrid cloud workloads
- Dynamic scalability & high resiliency
- Databand (licenses sold separately) can provide data observability to ensure data quality, security, and performance levels of the ETL jobs
Metrics based on research and client experiences:
- 30% throughput execution improvement over legacy DataStage
- 87% savings in development cost when using GUI compared to hand-coding ETL jobs
- 60% increased efficiency (minimal upgrade efforts)

For client-facing material, see the Compelling Reason to Act in the [Engage Client Phase](#engage-client-phase) section.

#### How complex is modernization?
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. The purpose of the Technology Expert Labs Assessment is to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan. You can find a graphical view of the modernization and an example report from Technology Expert Labs starting on slide 44 of the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/5uxv3r7htt6vus6ljn1uypt3jxrz30zz">IBMs DataStage Modernization PoV Deck</a>

Read DataStage Product Management's views and thoughts on having a Modernization Discussion with your client: [DataStage NextGen Review](https://github.ibm.com/Stephanie-Valarezo1/ds-nextgen-review)


In summary, assets can be modernized from DataStage Standalone to DataStage NextGen on Cloud Pak for Data using one of the three paths (and only one path is manual):
- Automated (ISX Import Service) - Parallel Jobs, Parallel Shared Containers, Parameter Sets, Parallel Routines
- Semi-Automated Migration Tool (MettleCI) - Server Jobs
- Manual Rewrite - Server Routines

IBM has confidence that DataStage NextGen is ready for customers to modernize from IBM Infosphere DataStage, IBM Infosphere QualityStage or IBM Information Server and that a repeatable process exists with our DataStage modernization journey.<br/>
