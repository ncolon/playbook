## What is Watson OpenScale and what does it do? <br/>
Use IBM Watson OpenScale to analyze your AI with trust and transparency and understand how your AI models make decisions. Detect and mitigate bias and drift. Increase the quality and accuracy of your predictions. Explain transactions and perform what-if analysis. <br/><br/>
IBM Watson OpenScale is an enterprise-grade environment for AI applications that provides your enterprise visibility into how your AI is built, is used, and delivers return on investment. Its open platform enables businesses to operate and automate AI at scale with transparent, explainable outcomes that are free from harmful bias and drift.<br/><br/>
With the Watson OpenScale service, you can scale the adoption of trusted AI across enterprise applications on hosted on-premises environments or in a private cloud environment.<br/><br/> Watson OpenScale is part of the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCWFTHpdXGc768hB2GWdh4RBMXBd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>AI Governance pattern</a>

## What are the pain points that Watson OpenScale addresses?

**Pain Point: Bias/Fairness: ** need to ensure that AI model scoring is fair across gender, age, ethnicity, etc. Determine if the AI model is biased, even if sensitive data is not part of the model <br/>
**Pain Point: Drift: ** need to ensure that the model accuracy remains within a defined threshold.<br/>
**Pain Point: Explainability: ** need to explain in human understandable form why certain candidates are recommended above others<br/>
**Pain Point: Accuracy and Quality: ** need to increase accuracy and quality of model predictions<br/><br/>
The Watson OpenScale model trust capabilities in Watson Studio provide confidence in AI outcomes, and it spans the gap between the teams that operate AI and the business units that use these applications.<br/>
-- Measure the performance of production AI and its impact on business goals.<br/>
-- Automatically detect and mitigate harmful bias to improve outcomes<br/>
-- Govern and explain AI to maintain regulatory compliance<br/>
-- Enable the business user or project manager to understand AI outcomes<br/>

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Watson OpenScale follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCCbm8b4VcT9fG9FcMd9BGMTPRR3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>demonstrations</a> in Seismic can be used to help show the customer how Watson OpenScale can be used to address the problem areas<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering and CSM can work together to connect Watson OpenScale to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs, Business Partners and IBM Consulting can take ownership of an implementation project and guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

CSM JeongKwan Lee assisted <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/4gcqxwsrevpoupew1qp39h2ah3zfjkwl' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Samsung</a> deploy machine learning models through WML, make it easy to apply services, monitor their quality periodically to continuously check the health of the models, and build a pipeline that continuously deploys models to remote branches.

## How do I expand and grow Watson OpenScale usage?

Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment. From there, the positioning of additional services driven by new use cases will validate the need for additional compute or CP4D services. There are ten solutions for enterprise GRC that Watson OpenScale supports which can be gradually implemented over time: <br/>
-- Measure the performance of production AI and its impact on business goals.<br/>
-- Automatically detect and mitigate harmful bias to improve outcomes<br/>
-- Govern and explain AI to maintain regulatory compliance<br/>
-- Enable the business user or project manager to understand AI outcomes<br/>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. <br/>
Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. <br/>
If you need assistance running a workshop reach out to the Practice Leaders: Dave Mulley or Campbell Robertson for assistance. <br/>
You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement)

**Customer facing case studies?**

<a href='https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/general-motors' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Walmart</a> has a company-wide focus on social responsibility, and they are investing heavily to ensure that fairness and trust are established also for their AI/ML models. The client saw that IBMâ€™s Watson OpenScale on Cloud Pak for Data was lightyears ahead of the competition in this area, so they purchased it and also added Expert Labs services for implementing each of their use cases.
