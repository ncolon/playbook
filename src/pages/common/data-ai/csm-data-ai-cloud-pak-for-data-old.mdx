## What do CSM-driven deployments look like?

**AI Lifecycle**

Data science teams are looking for integrated systems to manage assets across AI lifecycle, while enterprise Chief Data Officers (CDOs) want to ensure governance of AI models and datasets associated with them. Cloud Pak for Data enables the end-to-end AI Lifecycle from data preparation to building and deploying models to managing them at scale all the while ensuring governance of data and AI models. Enterprises can realize an integrated experience, automation and the benefits of AI governance including bias detection, explainability, model fairness and drift detection.

**Data Modernization**

Enterprises are grappling with the proliferation of data, with data distributed across multiple silos, databases, and clouds. Cloud Pak for Data addresses this through governed data virtualization enabling self-service access to data in real time. It also includes a comprehensive set of capabilities to discover, prep, transform, govern, catalog and access data at scale across all enterprise data sources.

**Data Ops**

Organizations want to enforce policy controls to allow access to ALL relevant data sets. Cloud Pak for Data enables enterprises to scale their data operations and enforce policies on individual columns and rows, so that assets with sensitive data can still be used. Among other things, this pattern includes capabilities around data preparation, data quality, lineage, and regulatory compliance.

**Self-service analytics**

Data is the world's most valuable asset and is a competitive differentiator if used appropriately. Data warehouse and BI is one of the foundational use cases which entails collecting relevant data and building reports/dashboards to derive business insights. Cloud Pak for Data includes everything you need to persist, visualize and analyze data at scale.

**AI for financial operations**

Financial and operation planning in enterprises is often multi-dimensional spanning a number of people and departments. Cloud Pak for Data enables automated and integrated planning across your organization, from financial planning and analysis to workforce planning, sales forecasting to supply chain planning. Empower your organization to deliver more agile, reliable plans and forecasts to drive better business performance.

**AI for Customer Care**

Automating customer care is one of the key enterprise use cases of AI. Among other things, Watson helps reduce time to resolution, call volume, and increases customer satisfaction. Watson Assistant (WA) can provide AI-powered automated assistance to customers or employees through web/mobile or voice channels and enable human agents to better handle customer inquiries. Watson Discovery (WD) compliments Watson Assistant and can help unlock insights from complex business content â€“ manuals, contracts, and scanned pdfs.

## Cloud Pak for Data Reference Architecture

[Latest Release of CP4D Material ](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Folder/DC7b6c86b)<br/>
Use the Cognitive Solution Architect: [https://w3.ibm.com/tools/cogarch/pagelogin](https://w3.ibm.com/tools/cogarch/pagelogin)<br/>
Refer to the [IBM Cloud Pak Playbook](https://playbook.cloudpaklab.ibm.com/)

You can also have your architectural pattern or plan reviewed by SMEs and Practice Leaders [here](https://github.ibm.com/customer-success-management/architecture-review/issues)

## How do I expand and grow CP4D usage?
Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment.  From there the positioning of additional services driven by new use cases will validate the need for additional compute or CP4D services.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs.  Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time.  If you need assistance running a workshop reach out to the Practice Leaders:  Campbell Robertson for assistance.  You can also ask to have Client Engineering (IBM Invest) or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement)<br/>

Another approach is to run a **Discovery/Solution Workshop** to define a use case and solution design.  Reach out to your Practice Leader - [Campbell Robertson](cir@ca.ibm.com)

## Advanced OpenShift Architecture for CP4D

Three advanced use cases for deploying CP4D on OCP.  Supporting links to documentation and slide material.

**Use Case # 1:** I need to share my existing OpenShift cluster with CP4D, without impacting my other workloads. I won't change worker node configuration parameters cluster-wide.

**â€¢Solution:** Machine Config Operator

- MachineConfigPools
- MachineSets
- MachineConfig
- ContainerRuntimeConfig
- KubeletConfig
- Namespace Placement
- Namespace Pull Secrets

**Use Case #2: Scaling**<br/>

- My customer is now also interested in DataStage. I need to add more CP4D nodes. Sales Configurator: 128 vCPU, 512GB, 8 nodes<br/>
- My customer needs to deploy cpu and/or memory-intensive workloads. 16vCPU and 64GB per node is not enough. I need to add capacity to my existing CP4D nodes.<br/>
- My customer has outgrown their existing OpenShift cluster; or, my etcd performance is resource-constrained. I need to add capacity to my Control Plane Nodes. NEW IN OCP 4.12<br/>

**Use Case #3: Network & Security**
I want to limit the IP address that will connect to my internal data sources. Whitelisting the whole machineNetwork CIDR range (10.0.0.0/16 by default) is not an option, as it conflicts with my security policies<br/>
