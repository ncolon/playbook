## Overview

The core watsonx products are watsonx.ai and watsonx.data and watsonx.governance.  Understanding how they all fit together is important to conceptualize the capabilities and more importantly the value to a client. <br/><br/>
Cloud Pak for Data is a key factor in the overall strategy for a client.  CP4D is the robust data fabric architecture and deployment platform for other key services in the Data & AI portfolio. <br/><br/> 



## What are the watsonx.data use cases?

**AI/ML at scale**: Build, train, tune, deploy and monitor trusted AI/ML models for mission-critical workloads with data in watsonx.data and ensure compliance with lineage and reproducibility of data used for AI <br/><br/>
**Real-time analytics and business intelligence**: Combine data from existing sources with new data in watsonx.data to unlock new, faster insights without the cost and complexity of duplicating and moving data across different environments. <br/><br/>
**Streamline data engineering**: Reduce data pipelines, simplify data transformation, and enrich data for consumption using SQL, Python, or an AI-infused conversational interface. <br/><br/>
**Share data responsibly**: Enable self-service access for more users to more data while ensuring security and compliance with centralized governance and local automated policy enforcement.

## Where does watsonx.data run?
watsonx.data can run on SaaS and as "Software" on OpenShift. Consider [Fusion HCI](/common/storage/fusionHCI/) <br/>
Notes:
1. In the initial releases, the *AWS SaaS* option will **not** be available in the AWS Marketplace and instead will be purchased through IBM Cloud and provisioned on AWS.
2. The *software* option can be deployed anywhere that OpenShift runs and can run without Cloud Pak for Data or as a Cloud Pak for Data Cartridge. watsonx.data **does not** require Cloud Pak for Data
3. The *software* option contains a slim version of foundational services that are required for IAM, metering, billing and a common look and feel.

## What is watsonx.data? <br/>
The next-gen watsonx.data lakehouse is designed to overcome the costs and complexities enterprises face. This will be the world’s first and only open data store with multi-engine support that is built for hybrid deployment across your entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>
watsonx.data is the only lakehouse with multiple query engines allowing you to optimize costs and performance by pairing the right workload with the right engine.
-	Run all workloads from a single pane of glass, eliminating trade-offs with convenience while still improving cost and performance.
-	Deploy anywhere with full support for hybrid-cloud and multicloud environments.
-	Shared metadata across multiple engines eliminates the need to re-catalog, accelerating time to value while ensuring governance and eliminating costly implementation efforts.

watsonx.data provides the next level of Data Lakehouse technology to the marketplace and will extract better value from data in ineffective data lakes by modernizing and enabling warehouse-like capabilities. The product can be installed on-premise, on a cloud, or provisioned as part of a managed service and be up and running in as little as 10 minutes.<br/><br/>
watsonx.data uses a combination of open-source components, including Apache Parquet, Apache ICEberg, and low-cost object storage to provide for high-performance analytics.<br/><br/>
Enterprise compliance and security will be built in from the start, and not as an afterthought, to provide unified governance across your entire ecosystem.<br/><br/>
Fit-for-purpose engines will optimize costly warehouse workloads, with engines that scale up/down automatically with your needs.
watsonx.data provides a simple UX and “click-and-go” console to ingest, access, transform data, and run workloads.<br/><br/>
Finally, watsonx.data will integrate with IBM’s robust ecosystem of technologies and a broad set of 3rd party partners to enable easy development and deployment of your use cases.

## Key concepts for watsonx.data

**watsonx.data** is IBM's entry into the Lakehouse market. It is a new (to IBM) data management system.<br/><br/>
**watsonx.data** enables a mutli-engine analytics approach based on a Hive Metastore that acts as a Database Catalog many engines can use.<br/><br/>
**Presto** is a new-generation open-source SQL engine designed to run efficiently over data lakes. IBM acquired Ahana which is a major presto contributor and created Prestissmo (presto improved with C++)<br/><br/>
**Warehouses and first generation lakehouses** are monolithic, and not optimized to work on all workloads. Only IBM watsonx.data's multi-engine architecture allows for true workload optimization<br/><br/>
**Iceberg** is a new open-table format that allows multiple engines to access the same data – this means, Snowflake, Netezza and IBM watsonx.data can all access data in Iceberg at the same time


## watsonx.data terminology

Traditional approaches to addressing data challenges have created complexity and cost, leading to the emergence of Data Lakehouse architectures.  Below are more comprehensive definitions of these approaches and lakehouse to help you understand the differences:

![watsonx-lakehouse](/images/watsonx-lakehouse.png)<br/>



**Data Warehouse**: A relational data store designed for analytics and reporting. Data is typically moved from many transactional sources into a warehouse. It can be on-premises, in open systems or a mainframe, or in the cloud, either fully managed or in software installed on cloud infrastructure.<br/><br/>
**Data Virtualization**: Federation Technology which creates a logical view of data from many data sources. A central “coordinator” runs queries against multiple data sources without relocating data. It makes data from many systems appear as if they are in a single database. IBM DV is built on BigSQL technology. Access through DV is currently read-only. Because it accesses data live without relocating it, DV CAN impact the performance of target systems—so the capacity of the target system is a factor. Note: Data Virtualization in Cloud Pak for Data improves on Federation by allowing for multiple coordinator nodes and other performance features. But the underlying connections to data sources are identical.<br/><br/>
**Data Lake**: Data Lakes became popular with the advent of Hadoop—which promised warehouse-like performance on commodity hardware and accepted both structured and unstructured (or semi-structured) data. Data is moved from wherever it is created to storage attached to the Hadoop cluster. The processing was intended to occur close to the data for maximum performance. While Hadoop retains its presence, most feel its value was not fully realized. It wound up being more complicated and expensive than promised.<br/><br/>
**Lakehouse**: A Lakehouse is the evolution of the data lake built on Object Storage. Object Storage is economical, includes replication for High Availability, and can be addressed with the s3 API no matter where it is—in a cloud, on an appliance, or deployed via software, such as Ceph or OpenShift Data Foundations. It is also built on popular open-source file and table formats, like Parquet, Avro, iceberg, and HUDI. Data is copied or relocated into s3 buckets to be serviced by a query engine. Different companies implement Lakehouse differently.<br/><br/>
**watsonx.data**: IBM’s Lakehouse entry combines the above lakehouse definition with data federation. That means we not only allow for data to be copied or relocated into object storage, it can also be virtualized without moving it. That means customers can take advantage of s3 and open-source formats at their own pace—adding new s3 workloads without a requirement to rapidly abandon other structures. IBM’s Multi-engine approach also means that High Performance Data Warehouses can continue to perform their specialized workloads, while other engines execute overlapping workloads in a price-performant environment. Spark and presto can be sized as workloads demand. All engines can update the same data thanks to the Shared Hive Metastore (a system catalog for open-source tables). Federation in wastonx.data is built on presto and its many connectors. Compared to DV, it is read/write, but does not have the same options for performance improvement.

## watsonx.data scoping, sizing, and implementation considerations

The current engagement model above highlights that Sales, Tech Sales, and Client Engineering should be capturing use cases, workload assessments, and sizing data.  However, as a CSM or TEL Service Seller, you want to ensure that all data is captured to have a successful deployment strategy.

**Deployment steps to focus on and ensure that the analysis and planning have been done:**

**Validate or understand the use case** that was captured during the sales cycle or CE workshops.<br/>
**If no current Use Case exists, engage** a TEL Solution Engineer who can assist with a workshop (IBM Invest). <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE. </a><br/><br/>

Proper sizing and workload assessment driven by an agreed-upon use case will dictate deployment strategy.<br/>
**Review** the existing Workload Assessment that should have been captured by Tech-Sales, Client Engineering, or Sales.<br/>
**If no existing workload assessment, align** use case to workload type and assessment. watsonx.data has multiple query engines and
storage options, select the one that aligns the use case data analysis to the type of query engine and storage classes. <a href='https://ibm.biz/grow-my-deal' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Request a TEL SE.</a><br/><br/>
**Validation of sizing** from the Sales team or the Solution Engineer will validate the sizing and or recommend the proper sizing configuration based on the entitlements.<br/>
**If sizing information is not available, refer** to the watsonx.data sizing tools: <a href='https://app.ibmsalesconfigurator.com/#/zen/home' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'> Sales Configurator link</a> and the <a href ='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC4QGj6Q4Bjm487X6jp6dqm2QGqd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>watsonx.data T-Shirt Sizing.</a><br/><br/>

**If this is to be a SaaS deployment of watsonx.data<br/>
   **Request** the provisioning documentation for SQA from the sales team.<br/>
   **Understand how to onboard** a client to IBM Cloud <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/vt5bhdeh8pq65j20wlez3f0b5ias0m0p' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here.</a><br/>

## watsonx.data competitors
Given that watsonx.data is addressing both the data lake and data warehousing fields by providing an open and flexible lakehouse topology the competitive field is broad this is the high-level view of of our major competitors. 

![watsonx competition](../images/watsonx-data-competition.png)

## watsonx.data components

### Presto

Presto is an open-source, fast and reliable SQL engine for Data Analytics and data lake houses.

Presto allows watsonx.data to be a preferred tool for data engineers. Presto helps to manage multiple query languages and interfaces from siloed databases and storage and can be used with data analytics and business intelligence tools

**Presto takeaways**:

**One Language**: One familiar ANSI SQL Language and one engine for your data analytics. Can be used with interactive and batch workloads, small and large amounts of data

**One Interface**: One place to reach all of your data regardless of where it is. Separates storage and compute allows you to run queries where your data lives

**Scalability**: Price-performance and optimized to meet growing data sizes and workloads. Scales from a few to thousands of users

**Ad-hoc Query**: Removes the need for traditional ETL processes. Ready to query, wherever and whenever you want

**Reporting and Dashboarding**: Enhances business intelligence. Create thorough visualizations and reports with all of your data in one

Stores data in Object Store buckets in the Iceberg open data format to facilitate data access and sharing across applications
Open Source 

<a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/9gbtjq7muyvk33jiozcyh1yeqd1uwlbg' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Detailed Presto Presentation</a>

### Iceberg

Apache Iceberg is central to Watsonx.data strategy. Traditional open data formats were born out of open source and were pervasive in data lakes like Hadoop, but they only provided append-only support. You cannot update a telephone number in the middle of a file. The new record would need to be appended to the file and the original record invalidated.

The Apache Iceberg open table format tries to address shortcomings of open file formats by providing additional metadata on top of file formats, ACID1 consistency for data lake tables which can be used to transform a Data Lake into a Lakehouse. Most importantly, Iceberg provides the ability to do updates against the data.

**Iceberg take aways**:

**Flexible compute**:  Don’t move data; multiple engines (many languages, not just JVMs) work seamlessly

**Iceberg FileIO (S3FileIO)**: Interface between core Iceberg library and underlying storage. S3FileIO adopts the latest S3 features for optimized security and performance

**Maintaining Iceberg Tables**: Table migration: In-Place migration or shadow migration to Iceberg, snapshot management, metadata management  (expire_snapshots, rewrite_data_files, etc.), compaction (taking several small files and rewriting to fewer larger files to speed up queries), expiring snapshots, remove orphan files.

<a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/9oilsw4nwkovo2zrlwm6s7orh1ab76q9' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Detailed Iceberg Presentation</a>

### Optimized storage:

There are two fundamental principles in the design of watsonx.data and the storage choices - you are not forced to migrate applications or data, nor are you tied into a single vendor. You don’t have to replace an existing system. You can run watsonx.data side by side with your existing system, and over time you can migrate your systems at your own pace, rather than being forced to migrate immediately.

**Storage tiers**

At a very simple level, we can categorize lakehouse storage into three tiers:
-	Bronze – Raw ingested data
-	Silver – Prepared data (i.e Iceberg or Parquet)
-	Gold – Optimized data

Each of these tiers has performance and cost characteristics associated with it. Any combination of these tiers can be found in a lakehouse, and data often moves between these tiers depending on the processing requirements. <br/><br/>
watsonx.data provides support for data residing in a variety of table formats and storage systems. Rather than having to migrate data to a new format, watsonx.data will provide access to your existing data by utilizing a variety of SQL engines (e.g., Apache Presto, Apache Spark). <br/><br/>
No vendor lock-in, and the use of open table formats, ensures that your investment is protected and you can access your data using a variety of utilities and tools.
