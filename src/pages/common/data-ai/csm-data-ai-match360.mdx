## What is IBM Match 360 and what does it do? <br/>
Our clients have a proliferation of data, across a variety of data sources. They need to be able to quickly match that data despite it being in separate warehouses, CRMs, and other databases and tools, then govern, protect, and make that data accessible to end teams and applications. They’re also turning to external data like social, location and weather data, or have invested in Experian, Dun & Bradstreet, or Axiom dataset, in order to enrich their existing customer profiles, gain insights when launching new products, provide accurate forecasting when entering new markets, and more.<br/><br/>
To take advantage of this data, IBM Match 360 with Watson helps our clients intelligently match data across sources to provide a self-serve, trusted, unified view of data to business users and applications. It allows teams to easily access, search, view, and analyze master data entities, whether it’s across internal or external sources or are person, organization, or custom entities. This enables teams to quickly use and act on their business-critical data, helping to lower costs and improve productivity, take advantage of analytics for hyper-personalization and next-best-offers, and infusing compliance, privacy, and fraud identification capabilities for better overall customer care.<br/> <br/>
IBM Match 360 is part of the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmpc4RFWTPXBGCT6dgRjTTGT78B' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Customer 360 pattern</a>


## What are the pain points that IBM Match 360 addresses?

**Pain Point: Drive new engagement and digital transformation: ** need to identify your most valuable customers based on the relationship they have with your company<br/>
**Pain Point: Optimize business processes that rely on customer data: ** need to empower agile teams to build their own fit-for-purpose 360-degree view<br/>
**Pain Point: Reduce exposure to business and security risks: ** need to optimize alignment between customer data rules and the business processes they support. <br/>

Customer data must be: <br/>
— discovered and cataloged<br/>
— resolved to a common identifier<br/>
— accessible to the business with privacy and compliance<br/>
— available to downstream applications<br/>
— trusted by the business and customer<br/>

The <a href='https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/X6MVBMO4' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Customer 360 for Data Leaders white paper</a>  describes the use cases and personas in detail

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

IBM Match 360 follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://www.ibm.com/demos/product-tours/open-pages/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>demonstrations</a> in Seismic can be used to help show the customer how IBM Match 360 can be used to address the problem areas<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering and CSM can work together to connect IBM Match 360 to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs, Business Partners and IBM Consulting can take ownership of an implementation project and guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## How do I expand and grow IBM Match 360 usage?

Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment. From there, the positioning of additional services driven by new use cases will validate the need for additional compute or CP4D services. There are ten solutions for enterprise GRC that IBM Match 360 supports which can be gradually implemented over time: <br/>
–- Operational risk management<br/>
–- Regulatory compliance management<br/>
–- Policy management<br/>
–- IT governance<br/>
–- Interal audit management<br/>
–- Model risk governance <br/>
–- Business continuity management<br/>
–- Third-party risk management<br/>
–- Financial controls management<br/>
–- Data privacy management<br/>


## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identfy and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. <br/>
Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. <br/>
If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders: Dave Mulley or Campbell Robertson for assistance. <br/>
You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement) <br/>
