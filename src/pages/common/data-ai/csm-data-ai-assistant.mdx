## What is Watson Assistant and what does it do?
**IBM Watson Assistant** is a no-code, easy-to-use platform for building and maintaining sophisticated virtual agents. Powered by artificial intelligence and leading natural language processing (NLP), these virtual assistants understand customers in the right context, and provide fast, consistent, and accurate answers across any application, device, or channel.<br/><br/>
**Typical Use Cases include:**<br/>
*1. Customer Service:* Decrease call center operations cost, while improving the customer support experience. <br/>
*2. Employee Productivity:* Simplify access to common questions and tasks through enterprise channels – often HR or IT related. <br/>
*3. Digital Customer Experience:* Provide guided buying experience for prospective customers to purchase goods and services through the mobile or messaging channel of their choice. <br/>

## What are the pain points that Watson Assistant addresses?<br/>
*"Your call is important to us. Due to unusually high call volume, you may experience a greater hold time than usual."*<br/><br/>
Today’s consumers expect an unprecedented level of customer service, more than any previous generation. When businesses don’t meet their service expectations, customers are vocal about it, share bad experiences widely, and often take their business elsewhere. Consider that a staggering 78% of customers will back out of purchases due to a poor customer experience! <br/><br/>
**Pain Point:** Limited options for customers and/or employees to self-serve.<br/>
Self-service options tend to fail when they're not flexible enough to meet changing customer and business needs resulting in low customer satisfaction. Pointing a customer to FAQs or a document may not address their specific question or help them perform the transaction they are looking to execute.<br/>
Watson Assistant can operate across multiple channels like websites, mobile apps, phone/IVR, to help customers and employees self-serve 24/7 thereby improving customer satisfaction.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point:** Rising contact center costs.<br/>
Watson Assistant can help lower support costs by deflecting non-complex requests from live agents as well. When paired with Watson Discovery it can help reduce time to resolution for agents who spend valuable time searching for answers.<br/><br/>
**Pain Point:** Increasing development costs.<br/>
Watson Assistant provides a no code authoring environment and out of the box integrations to simplify the development of assistants.<br/><br/>


## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Watson Assistant follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above along with the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCf8CCWJj4p6fG7D3CHqbWVD6dmd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Innovation Workshop</a> or a <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/client-engineering/engage' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Client Engineering</a> engagement to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCpDd4688RDp9GWRb4pBX6GChXmd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>LENDYR Demo</a> has a script that can be used to quickly demonstrate the capabilities of Instana to the customer<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect Watson Assistant to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Expert Labs can take ownership of an implementation project using their <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCHgM3JQfmVd7GFVd36jTPqhBT2P' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>pre-packaged offerings.</a><br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

The <a href='https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>University of Aukland</a> is the largest, most comprehensive and highest-ranked university in New Zealand and consistently places among the Top 100 universities in the world. The University have undertaken a number of digital transformation projects involving Conversational AI to improve self-service to its university applications for its student, staff, alumni, and local community populations. The CSM facilitated a number of reference calls to help include Watson Assistant in those projects and inspire new use case. The CSM also supported the local Service providers in their deployments.<br/>

## Why would a customer deploy Watson Assistant if they already have an existing chat bot solution?

Customers may have an existing contact center platform, or have built out existing chatbots with developer-centric products, or they may have already invested in an another conversational AI platform already.<br/><br/>

## How do I expand and grow Watson Assistant usage?

Watson Assistant's <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCilovvjt8P0yqi1RKqIIgyA' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>pricing</a> is based on Monthly Active Users (MAU). A monthly active user is an individual who interacts meaningfully with Watson Assistant one or more times a month. For example, if a caller has a conversation with a voice agent on Monday and calls again on Tuesday and Wednesday, IBM charges the client for just one MAU.<br/><br/>
Here are a number of ways to expand Watson Assistant's footprint to drive additional usage:
  * Expand the subject domain so the assistant can handle additional topics and/or support additional processes expanding its coverage.
  * Leverage custom extensions to help solve specific user problems, for example, connecting to a human agent or searching existing help content.
  * Deploy the assistant to other channels like Phone, Web Chat, SMS, Email, Slack, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, etc..
  * Extend the solution to support additional languages or call out to Natural Language Understanding API to determine end user sentiment.

Work with your client to collect as-is data points before deploying the assistant. Once the assistant is live look to measure its effectiveness by capturing conversation containment and task completion as well as coverage which measures the portion of total messages your assistant recognizes and can respond to.<br/>

**Customer facing case studies?**

<a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/spotlight-stories/2022-csm-spotlight/maricopa-county' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>The Clerk of the Superior Court in Maricopa Count</a> receives more than 33,000 calls and 75,000 web inquiries each month. With such a large volume of requests, the Clerk's staff spent most of their time answering routine questions, processing the documents and transferring customers to different departments instead of being able to focus on supporting more complex customer issues. This led to frustration for customers and increased handling time for staff.<br/>
