### watsonx.ai Product Feature Adoption and Value Realized Indicators
Product Feature Adoption and Value Realized Indicators are instrumented in the product to show the capabilities and features that the customer is using. This information can be used to determine the level of adoption that has taken place and ensure that the customer is receiving full business value from the product. See below for novice, intermediate and advanced level indicators along with an asset listing the value proposition, expected benefits, considerations for implementation and metrics of success.
<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Novice level indicators">

| Product Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inferencing against a pre-trained model | Inferencing against a pre-trained Generative AI model refers to the utilization of a model that has already been trained on a large amount of data, to generate new, usually creative outputs. This involves passing inputs into the model, which then uses its learned patterns to create a plausible output.|
| Model Parameters | Model Parameters have been changed/modified and saved 

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Intermediate level indicators">

| Product Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inferencing against deployed model | Inferencing against a deployed/trained Generative AI model refers to the process of generating new data or predictions based on the knowledge that the AI model has gained during its training phase. The user provides an input prompt or seed to the AI model, and the model uses complex algorithms and learned patterns to generate a meaningful output.  |
| Assign a model a space id | User has created a deployment space on IBM Cloud and has assigned a space ID for the model |

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Advance level indicators">

| Product Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inference against a tuned model |  By 'inferencing', we are referring to the application of the tuned model to new input data to create an output. For example, once a language-based generative AI model is tuned (trained and validated with large datasets), the inferencing stage involves providing the model with a novel input, such as a sentence or a question, to which the AI responds by generating appropriate text based on what it has learned during its training phase.|
| Model Tuning | Tuning a generative AI model involves the process of optimizing the hyperparameters that control the model behavior. These hyperparameters can include learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of units per layer, activation function, optimization algorithm, regularization parameters and more. Tuning aims to find the optimal configuration of these hyperparameters that results in the best performance for a given task. Various strategies can be used for tuning, such as grid search, random search or Bayesian optimization. The process generally involves training the model with different sets of hyperparameters, assessing performance on a validation set, and updating hyperparameters based on these performance results, to reduce overfitting and improve generalization on unseen data. |
| Using Features through Jupyter Notebook| The models can then be used by providing input data and calling the model's prediction function. Results can be processed and visualized in the Jupyter Notebook, which offers a versatile platform for experimentation and analysis. |
| Using Features through IDE |  Generative AI models can be integrated into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to enhance the programming process by providing code autocomplete, documentation generation, bug detection, and code review suggestions|

| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM CSM (utilizing Billable Services if the customer has paid) | Customer has access to IBM Cloud and watsonx.ai services (Tile). | **Sizing and planning**<br/> The use case(s) that the customer wants to address with watsonx.data will determine the configuration of the runtime environment and should be determined before the environment is provisioned. Refer to the steps in the <Link to='/common/acceleration-plays/watsonx-ai-play'>watsonx.ai Acceleration Play</Link>, which covers sizing to determine what will need to be provisioned. <br/><br/> **Provisioning the service**<br/> Use the <a href='https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/get-started-wdp.html?context=wx&audience=wdp' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Getting Started</a> section of the watsonx.ai Documentation along with the <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/vt5bhdeh8pq65j20wlez3f0b5ias0m0p' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>CS IBM Cloud onboarding guide</a> to guide your customer through the process of provisioning the watsonx.data service. <br/><br/> A <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/updmi0x1ke74e9j4qnt0usz1fge1v44c" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Welcome Email Template</a> is available and can be used to introduce yourself to your client and provide links to the product documentation, how to raise a support ticket, how to join the watsonx Community and enablement material. |
