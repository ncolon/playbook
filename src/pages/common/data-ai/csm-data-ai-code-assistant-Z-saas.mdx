**Example**: <br/>
The overall process of modernizing existing applications will take many months and result in inconsistent usage of the SaaS-based **transform** engine that reports usage to Gainsight. Therefore, as long as the customer uses 8 RUs (converts 40000 lines of COBOL) in a 12-month window, then the entitlement will be marked as Deployed.
