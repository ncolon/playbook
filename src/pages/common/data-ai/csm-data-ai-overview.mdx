## IBM Fusion HCI Storage Considerations

IBM Fusion HCI is a hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) solution that integrates the Red Hat OpenShift container platform with a hybrid cloud data platform. It offers a turn-key enterprise-grade solution for deploying Red Hat OpenShift and simplifies the management of hardware and software. This solution is designed to be highly scalable, with features like erasure coding for data resilience, local and remote backup and recovery, and a global data platform for storage resources.

Key technical aspects of IBM Spectrum Fusion HCI include:
- Integrated HCI appliance for containers
- Scalable containerized file system
- Data resilience for backup and recovery
- Simple installation and maintenance
- Global data platform for storage resources
- Integration with IBM Cloud Satellite® and Red Hat ACM
- Support for AI applications with optional NVIDIA A100 GPUs
- Scalability from 6 to 20 servers.

IBM Spectrum Fusion HCI eliminates the need for excess VM layers typical in container environments, providing an optimized solution for running cloud-native applications and containers. It offers transparent access to data, simplifying both development and operational tasks. The solution is designed to be simple to manage, integrate with current and hybrid cloud environments, build and run container applications, deploy Red Hat OpenShift, and manage storage services efficiently.

In summary, IBM Fusion HCI (IBM Spectrum Fusion HCI) is a comprehensive hyper-converged infrastructure solution that combines the capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift with a hybrid cloud data platform to provide a scalable, resilient, and easy-to-manage environment for containerized applications and AI workloads.
