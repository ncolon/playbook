### CSM Scorecard Milestones based on usage

SaaS milestones for the CSM Scorecard are based on usage. To progress from Planning to Deploying to Deployed, see <Link to='/common/saas-growth/#data-and-ai-saas-milestones-based-on-usage'>Data and AI milestones based on usage</Link>.

**Note: the usage-based milestones are not automated in Gainsight; the Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status. Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard.**
