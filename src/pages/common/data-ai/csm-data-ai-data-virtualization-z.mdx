## What is Data Virtualization and what does it do?
Data Virtualization (DV) enables access to distributed data from disparate data sources in real time without physically moving the data.  Furthermore, queries are optimized to run where data resides, cutting down the response time.

## What are the pain points that Data Virtualization addresses?

DV takes an integrated approach and scale.  A unified experience of bringing data managment, data governance, and data analysis into a single platform resonates with


## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

## How do I expand and grow Data Virtualization usage?
Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment.  From there the positioning of addtional services driven by new use cases will valdiate the need for additional compute or CP4D services.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identfy and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs.  Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time.  If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders: Christian Peterman or Campbell Robertson for assistance.  You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Expert Labs (Paid Engagement)
