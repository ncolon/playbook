## What is OpenPages and what does it do? <br/>
IBM OpenPages with Watson is an AI-driven, highly scalable governance, risk and compliance (GRC) solution that runs on any cloud. Centralize siloed risk management functions within a single environment designed to help you identify, manage, monitor and report on risk and regulatory compliance, especially in today’s changing business landscape.<br/> OpenPages is part of the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCWFTHpdXGc768hB2GWdh4RBMXBd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>AI Governance pattern</a>

## What are the pain points that OpenPages addresses?

**Pain Point:** Lack of visibility into regulatory changes and how to manage their impacts <br/>
**Pain Point: ** Needing a consistent, aggregated view of risk across the organization <br/>
**Pain Point: ** Poor quality of GRC data and friction among data silos <br/>
**Pain Point: ** Lack of accountability of enterprise risk and compliance activities <br/>
**Pain Point: ** Need to reduce the likelihood of unexpected risk events <br/>
OpenPages with Watson offers businesses the capability to deploy solutions as needed with a forward-looking architecture that can grow as organizations grow. OpenPages is scalable to tens of thousands of users. This customizable platform provides a modular set of ten solutions for enterprise GRC that support: <br/>
–- Operational risk management<br/>
–- Regulatory compliance management<br/>
–- Policy management<br/>
–- IT governance<br/>
–- Interal audit management<br/>
–- Model risk governance <br/>
–- Business continuity management<br/>
–- Third-party risk management<br/>
–- Financial controls management<br/>
–- Data privacy management<br/>
More details are available in the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCCgd6hMdJTfp8qDQXHMjpDDDVWj' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>OpenPages Solution Brief</a>

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

OpenPages follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://www.ibm.com/demos/product-tours/open-pages/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>demonstrations</a> in Seismic can be used to help show the customer how OpenPages can be used to address the problem areas<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering and CSM can work together to connect OpenPages to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs, Business Partners and IBM Consulting can take ownership of an implementation project and guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

CSM Hui Sim NG assisted <a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/keotjo8pkwydbreae683n2kou0m42o0p' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Macquarie Group</a>  implement OpenPages to help process owners using Blueworks Live assess the risks of their changes. Client Engineering and the customers’ own “Innovation Labs” drove the project to bring process and risk assessment together.

## How do I expand and grow OpenPages usage?

Use Case and Sponsors will ensure a successful first project deployment. From there, the positioning of additional services driven by new use cases will validate the need for additional compute or CP4D services. There are ten solutions for enterprise GRC that OpenPages supports which can be gradually implemented over time: <br/>
–- Operational risk management<br/>
–- Regulatory compliance management<br/>
–- Policy management<br/>
–- IT governance<br/>
–- Interal audit management<br/>
–- Model risk governance <br/>
–- Business continuity management<br/>
–- Third-party risk management<br/>
–- Financial controls management<br/>
–- Data privacy management<br/>


## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
As a CSM drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identfy and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. <br/>
Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. <br/>
If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders: Dave Mulley or Campbell Robertson for assistance. <br/>
You can also ask to have Client Engineering, Data Elite Team, Data Science Elite team or Technology Expert Labs (Paid Engagement)
