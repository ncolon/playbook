## Looking for how to prospect for a use case for Databand?
We held a session with the Databand Sales and Product Management team specifically on how to prospect for sponsors and use cases for Databand. You can find the recording and associated <a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/qwvaub48ua6e35yq5nmhbh9zwuqkyhvv' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>assets in box</a>.

## What is Databand and what does it do? <br/>
Databand is the foundation of IBM's solution for **Data Observability**. Leverage Databand to monitor, identify and resolve data pipeline aberration to deliver reliable data to your consumers. Exploit the capabilities of data observability to address foundational data integration and governance for static and in motion data to improve data usage for analytics and AI to drive business outcomes.

## What are the pain points that Databand addresses?

The key pain points that Databand addresses are related operationalizing the immediate detection and resolution of data incidents. Catching issues before they create costly impacts to the business: <br/><br/>
**Pain Point: **Unable to detect data incidents, often relying on customers to raise issues <br/>
Databand can pinpoint unknown data incidents and reduce mean time to detection (MTTD) from days to minutes.<br/>
**Pain Point: **It can take hours or even days to resolve data incidents  <br/>
Databand can improve mean time to resolution (MTTR) with incident alerts and routing from weeks to hours.<br/>
**Pain Point: **Lack of trust that data is complete and accurate <br/><br/>
Databand can enhance reliability and data delivery SLAs, provide visibility into pipeline quality issues.<br/><br/>
Databand is single pane of glass to reduce risk exposure, increase speed and productivity and to achieve trusted data. If customers have Data Pipelines that are critical to their business, they will likely need Databand.


## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

Databand follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>
2: **Demonstrating how a given pain point can be addressed (demo)**<br/>
The <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCF4H9Rpfffc78cH2TFbM4WVfBDB#/?anchorId=ba3a0246-5d62-42f3-a09e-fc10eee6aa5d' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>demonstrations</a> in Seismic can be used to help show the customer how databand can be used to address the problem areas<br/><br/>
3: **Proving value (proof of experience (PoX))**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering and CSM can work together to connect Databand to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
4: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs, Business Partners and IBM Consulting can take ownership of an implementation project and guide the customer through the implementation project.<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

The PGP Glass CSM, Ankit Rastogi partnered with Technology Expert Labs to help the customer start to monitor their pipelines. PGP Glass have three different types of pipeline that Databand has been configured to observe:
  * Python-based data pipelines implemented in Azure Data Factory
  * Data pipelines using Spark notebooks in Databricks
  * Data engineering and data science pipelines implemented in a Kedro framework.

You can read more about the deployment in <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC6fTGgdQB34R8hD98gJTd6bVh88' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the deployment report</a> in Seismic

## How do I expand and grow Databand usage?

The proven Databand model is to land and expand by starting with a single application or line of business, prove value and the expand to other applications and business units. The "value" of Databand is easily quantifiable by looking at the following:
  * Reduction in time taken to detect incidents
  * Reduction in time taken to resolve incidents
  * Increase in quality of data

Quantifiable reductions and improvements are key to expansion. Collect as-is data points before deployment and 30, 60 and 90 days later compare the new results. The numbers will speak for themselves.


## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?
Most Data Science customers have a need to improve their Data Observability. The key is to identify who within your customer is experiencing one of more of the pain points listed above. <br/><br/>
We held a session with the Databand Sales and Product Management team specifically on how to prospect for sponsors and use cases for Databand. You can find the recording and associated <a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/qwvaub48ua6e35yq5nmhbh9zwuqkyhvv' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>assets in box</a>.<br/><br/>
Look for data engineering teams that are overextending themselves to process and deliver reliable data to their stakeholders. Teams are likely firefighting data reliability and quality incidents, making it difficult for them to focus on strategic initiatives. Investigate whether data provider SLAs are being met, and whether data consumers receive timely, high quality data. <br/><br/>
The leading message is to utilize Databand to transform from a reactive approach (where resources are spent dealing with incidents 24/7) to proactive Data Observability. Use the <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCVjXJCJqDpRT8hJ4pqmpDh2HhRG' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>sales narrative, messaging and approach document</a> to assist you through the process of finding a use case and sponsor. <br/><br/>
Once you have a use case and a sponsor, use Client Engineering to help you deliver a proof of value to the customer.
