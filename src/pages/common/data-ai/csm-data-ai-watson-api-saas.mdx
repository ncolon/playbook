## Overview
As a CSM, your focus will be to guide and nurture your customers who have Watson APIs (Speech to Text, Text to Speech, Natural Language Understanding) entitlements.  You will guide the customer with provisioning through to onboarding, help with their first use case, and continue to expand their use cases.

Refer to the <a href='https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/data-ai/csm-data-ai-watson-speech-to-text/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Watson Language Services Playbook</a> for the product overview, the pain points it addresses, what a CSM driven deployment looks like, and how to expand and grow a client's Watson APIs (and Customer Care) usage.

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM (utilizing Billable Services if the customer has paid) |  Watson APIs SaaS instance provisioned and the customer has access. |  Before provisioning, the CSM helps the customer review Pricing plans, <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/estimator' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Service plan cost</a>, and <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>How IBM Identity and Access Management works</a>. <br/><br/> **Technology Expert Labs Offerings**<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Assess Customer Care Diagnostics**: TEL team conducts an assessment of the client’s Customer Care solution to ensure they are optimizing the software to solve their business issues and realize the full value of their solution. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Plan Customer Care Workshop**: Clients choose a focus area for the workshop based on their business need including, but not limited to actions, artificial intelligence, analytics, governance, and integrations. <br/><br/>**Customer doesn’t have IBM Cloud account** <br/> - Getting started on <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-get-started-checklist' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Cloud checklist</a> <br/> - Understanding <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-compliance' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>compliance in IBM Cloud</a> <br/> - Create an <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/registration' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Cloud account</a> <br/><br/>**Customer already has IBM Cloud account** <br/> - <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Setting up the IBM Cloud account</a> <br/> - <a href='https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access-getstarted' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Assigning access to resources by using access groups</a>. |

### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM Architect/Digital CSM (utilizing Billable Services if the customer has paid) | Customer has validated access to their Watson APIs instance using their IBMid. <br/> <br/> After the Watson APIs instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the IBM Cloud account. <br/><br/> By default, the IAM for the instance is configured with IBM Verify and using IBMid.  A customer can configure the instance to use a different access management system but will need to work with support. | **Technology Expert Labs Offerings** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Assess Customer Care Diagnostics:** TEL team conducts an assessment of the client’s Customer Care solution to ensure they are optimizing the software to solve their business issues and realize the full value of their solution. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Plan Customer Care Workshop:** Clients choose a focus area for the workshop based on their business needs including, but not limited to actions, artificial intelligence, analytics, governance, and integrations. |

### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM Architect/Digital CSM or Technology Expert Labs | The client has implemented at least one use case and is receiving value. | **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:**<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Build Customer Care Solution:**  Depending on the scope, outcomes range anywhere from a custom virtual agent solution that can understand natural language, answer common questions, and assist users through routine business processes to a production-ready MVP with added integrations and digital/voice channels. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Customer Care Speech Analysis Toolkit:** Deploy/install an instance of Speech Analysis Tool kit for the client's project and onboard the project team on the operational usage of the asset. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Expertise Connect for Data and AI Expert Essential Services:** Expertise Connect offers a continuous engagement model for clients to access technical guidance from TEL - Software deep technical expertise at a fraction of the cost of typical consulting engagements. <br/><br/> **Create/enhance the solution** <br/> CSMs should utilize billable services from Technology Expert Labs to design and implement the solution for the customer. <br/> CSMs that have customers that want to perform the first design and implementation without the support of Technology Expert Labs will need to provide support themselves using experience gained from completing the enablement classes. <br/><br/>**Operate the solution** <br/> CSMs should utilize billable services from Technology Expert Labs to instruct the customer on how to operate the solution for the customer. <br/>CSMs that have customers that want to perform the activities without the support of Technology Expert Labs will need to provide support themselves using experience gained from completing the enablement classes.  | 

### Confirm Value & Expand

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM Architect/Digital CSM | Customer has realized value and expanding usage to new business use cases | **Nuture relationship** <br/> Set up a <Link to='/onboard/executive-business-review/'>EBR (executive business review)</Link> with client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen and confirm the customer's strategic goals have been met. <br/><br/> **Identify risk/opportunity** <br/> After Gainsight is configured later in 2024, you will be able to track the activities that the customer is performing in Watson APIs. This allows you to determine whether the customer is continuing to use the product or whether usage is dropping. <br/><br/> **Expand solution** <br/> A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services and look for opportunities to add more use cases using the <Link to='/common/acceleration-plays/customer-care-play/'>Customer Care and watsonx acceleration play</Link>. | 

### Renewed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM Architect/Digital CSM and/or Technical Sales | The client has confirmed that they are using the product and will continue to renew their entitlement. | N/A |
