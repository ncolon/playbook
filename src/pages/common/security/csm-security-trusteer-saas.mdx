**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard
