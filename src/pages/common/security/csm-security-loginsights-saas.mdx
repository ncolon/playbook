**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

## Overview
As a CSM, your focus will be to guide and nurture your customers, who have Log Insights entitlement.  You will guide the customer with provisioning through to onboarding, and help with their first use case (add a target, configure application discovery and grouping, take automated actions) and continue to expand their use case(s).

** As instrumentation is pending, CSMs can mark customers deployed, but this will require manager sign-off in Gainsight. **

#### How to locate your milestone metric without instrumentation <br />
For products that are currently not instrumented in Gainsight, CSMs might need to advise customers how to manually check current usage statistics within the product.

| No | New Feature Required | At this time there is no method for users or CSMs to view current usage consumption from within the product. Customers must contact the SRE team until instrumentation is available. | <br />

### Log Insights Product Feature Adoption and Value Realized Indicators  <br />
QRadar Log Insights includes 'Product Feature Adoption' and 'Value Realized Indicators', which are instrumented into the product. Instrumentation allows CSM to identify capabilities and features that your customer is using. This information can be used to determine the level of adoption that has taken place and ensure that the customer is receiving full business value from the product. See below for novice, intermediate and advanced level indicators along with an asset listing the value proposition, expected benefits, considerations for implementation and metrics of success.

<br />

### Provisioned
| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QRadar Log Insights SRE | QRadar Log Insights SaaS instance provisioned and the customer has access. |The QRadar Log Insights SaaS SRE team receives a request from sales to provision the customer and establish a Red Hat on OpenShift Services on AWS for the customer. The sales team sends a form to the SRE team to begin the provisioning process. The customer administrator is provided a welcome email with reference information with the location of their provisioned appliance. <br/><br/>**Request a 3-day free trial instance with demo data to test drive the UI and functionality**<br/>1. Log in to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52580" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>QRadar Log Insights “sandbox” trial</a>. <br/>2. Registered customers will be automatically provisioned with a QRadar Log Insights instance, pre-loaded with demo data. <br/>3. Users can follow the guided tours, as well as experience the product independently for 3 days. | <br /> **Note**: This is a UI tour with data and examples; there is no method for upgrading to a paid product at this time.  |


### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QRadar Log Insights SRE and CSM | Customer has validated access to their QRadar Log Insights SaaS instance. | After the QRadar Log Insights SaaS instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the AWS console (if provisioned from the AWS Marketplace) or from the email (if the request was submitted by an IBM Technical Seller). By default, the IAM for the instance is configured with IBM Verify and using IBMid. A customer can configure the instance to use a different access management system but will need to work with support.<br/><br/>If no activity has been taken by the client, an Onboarding Nudge Email Template <a href="https://#" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>(link TBD)</a> can be sent with instructions to add a target.<br/><br/>After the onboarding process has been completed, an Onboarded Email Template is available to advise the client to take the next step of their journey to take action. |


### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM or Technology Expert Labs | The product must be set as 'Deployed' in Gainsight. To meet the deployment criteria, the client has added data sources and consumes 15 GB/day (tier 1), 30 GB/day (tier 2), or 60 GB/day (tier 3) on average across the month of the purchased subscription capacity. Instrumentation is pending, but the average GB/day over the month is the requirement to be considered 'Deployed'. <br/><br/>As the consumption is not available to customers yet, QRadar Log Insights managers can manually mark a customer as deployed, until instrumentation is provided for these products. <br/><br/>You can learn more about QRadar Log Insights on the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/common/security/csm-security-loginsights" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>playbook page</a>. | It is the responsibility of the CSM to guide the customer through the deployment phase, utilizing Technology Expert Labs to assist with deployment or data sources that need to be added to the Data Collector. <br/><br/>**Technology Expert Labs Offerings:**<br/>**Advise Offerings/Plan Offerings** - Review of the architecture and topological design of an existing installation of a QRadar Suite product. Validate the appropriate platform for current and future performance requirements. <br /> A series of workshops to document high-level requirements and create a solution design overview to guide a future installation and build. <br/> **Implement Offerings** <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Migrate**: Migrate a product in the QRadar Suite from, On-Prem to SaaS, On-Prem to On-Prem or SaaS to On-Prem or refresh hardware. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Install/Configure**: Create an accelerated installation and distributed deployment, create custom use cases or patch/upgrade an existing solution to provide a next-generation security intelligence platform. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Build**: Deploy any QRadar suite solution component for a predefined scope, based on standard practices and a proven deployment approach.<br/> **Accelerate Offerings** - A subscription-based bundle of services, available at a fixed annual fee, that provides flexibility based on the client’s skills, project requirements, and business and technical needs. <br/> **Learn Offerings** <br/>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning Subscription Threat Management**: IBM Learning subscriptions offer continuous learning on products, to train individuals or teams, over 12 months, using online digital courses. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning Subscription w/Red Hat**: IBM Learning Subscription with Red Hat provides access to Security training material and content hosted by IBM training and Red Hat Learning platform. <br/><br/> For a full list of Expert Labs offerings with part numbers, see a <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCPDX46QbMgJc87Mb4GBJmpJ4bBd" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Security Threat Management Offerings</a>. |


### Confirm Value & Expand

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Customer has realized value and is expanding usage to new business units. | Set up a <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/executive-business-review/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>EBR (executive business review)</a> with client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen and confirm the customer's strategic goals have been met. <br/> A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services, look for opportunities to add more automation of actions and try to expand the adoption with other business units.

### Renewed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM and/or Technical Sales | The client has confirmed that they are using the product and will continue to renew their entitlement. | |
