## What is Trusteer and what does it do? <br/>

IBM Security™ Trusteer® helps organizations detect fraud, authenticate users and  establish identity trust across the omnichannel customer journey. It is designed to deliver a seamless experience by learning how  customers interact with apps and websites, including tracking behavioral analytics patterns such as device use, geolocation, session length and transaction norms. And Trusteer even offers biometric insights from customers’ mouse movement patterns and other digital interactions. That data, combined with our analytics, helps uncover abnormalities without interrupting ser­vice.

IBM Security Trusteer solutions include:

- **IBM Security™ Trusteer® Pinpoint Detect:** - Outsmart account takeover attempts with AI, behavioral biometrics and machine learning.
- **IBM Security™ Trusteer® Pinpoint Assure:** - Help power digital transformations by seamlessly assessing the risk of new and guest digital identities.
- **IBM Security™ Trusteer® Mobile SDK:** - Enhance your mobile growth with real-time device and session risk assessment.
- **IBM Security™ Trusteer® Rapport:** - Detect and remediate malware and identify phishing attacks within a matter of minutes.

## What are the pain points that Trusteer addresses?

**Pain point:** New business initiatives to improve profitability performance for line of business omnichannel applications. IBM Trusteer helps organizations quickly and transparently establish digital identity trust for both web and mobile channels. This can allow companies to create a more seamless customer experience without compromising on security.

**Pain point:** Customers struggle with complex login authentication and identity challenges to access their digital accounts. Account related fraud is impacting support teams. Trusteer Pinpoint Assure fights unknown user fraud and seamlessly assess the identity risk of new and guest digital identities.

**Pain point:** Increased threat of attacks on the digital accounts from external sources. Trusteer Rapport advanced endpoint protection and remediation solution designed to protect users from malware and
phishing attacks.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/><br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/><br/>Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC3fh8mC92bXf8fCRpdBJFM4m83d" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of Trusteer</a>. This client deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the Trusteer and what is available in it. <br/><br/> Be an advocate for the customers and guide them on Trusteer products and resources. Make sure you represent the client internally. Develop and drive the level of product knowledge and usage within the customer environment.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/><br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/><br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between <a href='https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=i126-8418&lc=en#detail-document' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Trusteer Services</a>, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/ozg1huh7n8vy2vnujv0vhn45l7u78y57' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>ANZ Bank</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Miranda Song) worked with them to implement the Trusteer Pinpoint Detect solution.

Please note that the above reference is not a public reference. This is not customer referenceable and use it internally only for educational purposes.

## How do I expand and grow Trusteer usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of Trusteer.

IBM Trusteer helps organizations seamlessly establish digital identity trust across the omnichannel customer journey. Through cloud-based intelligence, backed by AI and machine learning, Trusteer provides a holistic platform designed to help clients welcome in new and existing customers, while keeping bad actors out. Organizations are
enabled with the ability to establish a trusted, frictionless digital relationship quickly and transparently. Trusteer can detect > 90% of fraud and reduce the step-up authentication rate from 20% to < 5%. Trusteer enables clients to meet regulatory requirements such as PSD2 (European regulation for electronic payment services).

As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.

Use the following conversation starters as references:
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC2V98FXJVmFmG7WqTGMcmTRTC8d' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Conversation Guide Elevator Pitch</a>

Also, make sure the following things are addressed.

-	Ensure client success via education, adoption, best practices, reporting etc.
-	Understand the clients goals for their Trusteer solution(s) and ensure they have the opportunity and knowledge to maximize their ROI.
- Suggest updates and changes as our business evolves by running Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) / Service Reviews (SRs). Engage with the Trusteer Fraud Service Managers and	follow all the necessary QBR/SR guidelines documents.

We also have a bunch of case studies here in the <a href="https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' >Use Case Repository (deprecated)</a> and the <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STARS repository.</a><br/>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Trusteer Services.

* **Where can I find more Pricing information ?**

  Few useful resources are:

  - <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCT8JBcG39mhf8WXfjRgQCFQ8TRd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Trusteer Pricing - 101</a>

  Feel free to check <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCQpM2fHWRqppGHHpVcXqjFmdFhP' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>L0 Rules Checklist</a>.

* **How to check if the ordered quantities match usage ?**

  Contact Trusteer team to confirm the number of Connections, Active Users or Eligible Participants used by the customer. Request <a href='https://trusteer.formtitan.com/report-request#/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Report</a> on usage quantities from Trusteer. This will be a 360 Day rolling report.
