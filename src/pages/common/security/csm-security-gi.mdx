## What is Guardium Insights and what does it do? <br/>

**IBM Security Guardium Insights** is the heart of the Guardium Data Security Platform. Guardium Insights supports data security and compliance use cases, and it helps clients simplify their existing data security architecture and enables access to long-term data security and compliance data. It helps improve analytics to uncover hidden threats, provides security teams with rich, context-based risk scoring and alerting, and enables automated ticket creation and playbook enrichment.

IBM Security Guardium Insights is a powerful tool that can help you secure your data. Simple to use, Guardium Insights allows you to set up connections to your data sources.

Guardium Insights provides tools to help you analyze data:

- Outlier mining: Detecting anomalies in activities and exceptions.
- Risk events: Identifying assets at risk using broad data points.
- Reports: Dive into the raw data for deep investigation.

## What are the pain points that Guardium Insights addresses?

**Pain Point:** Discovering sensitive data and centralizing data security across diverse cloud and on-premises environments is challenging. ***IBM Security Guardium Insights*** provides centralized visibility by monitoring and analyzing activity in context to gain a consistent security view from disparate sources across hybrid environment.

**Pain Point:** Responding to threats more efficiently across security teams to boost collaboration and reduce alert fatigue. ***IBM Security Guardium Insights*** applies advanced analytics to quickly identify data risks and threat patterns, enabling immediate action and keeping all stakeholders informed. It also scales protection, adapt to new sources, and quickly integrate with other IT and security tools to share enriched, contextual data security insights across teams.

**Pain Point:** Data security teams need help with compliance. Complying with current and future data regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, SOX, HIPAA, or others and quickly validating the compliance is important. ***IBM Security Guardium Insights*** provides accelerated compliance. It speeds up compliance with automated auditing and compliance reporting, using out-of-the-box and advanced, customizable reports and content.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCMXqFhXfjJpBG7JMJj6q6WhH7mV" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Security Guardium Insights</a>.  This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security Guardium Insights and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-1" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value (proof of experience (PoX)) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/x9asukyilnxhloam1io0h73gv1vn98yd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Banco Central do Brasil</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Henderson Cerqueira) worked with them to use IBM Guardium Insights for increasing and improving visibility as well as monitoring of access to data and systems, in addition to meeting the Bank's LGPD standards.

## How do I expand and grow Guardium usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM Guardium Insights software. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>
Use the following conversation starters as references: <br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCRpT46cTgP8289D9pW9RTXqF36B' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Security Guardium Insights for IBM Cloud Pak for Security</a><br/><br/>

<AccordionItem title='How to run a GVA Workshop ?'>

#### Executing a GVA Report
Once a GVA has been scheduled, consider the following steps in executing a successful and effective workshop.
1. Start with the <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/198964392246" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GVA Snapshot</a>. Send the customer a link to complete the <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/6561334/ibmgdr" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GVA Pre-Engagement Survey</a> or send them the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/sb2b4wywb6qwgrl498wvqdk3tg2ofan5" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>spreadsheet</a> of the questionnaire to go through together. This questionnaire will capture the details of the current state of their environment. If using the online survey tool, you can receive a code from <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/#/people/1J4179897" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tiana Sullivan</a> or <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/#/people/1J2400897" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Ashish John</a> as well as the survey results.
2. If the customer would like to get a deeper technical understanding of their Guardium environment, do the full GVA workshop. Utilize the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/ge3v6ocrq71z9p25g447b4k3uj9ddssw" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GVA Questionnaire</a> to guide your conversation, break the question set down into focused segments, and record the customerâ€™s responses and comments.
3. For virtual GVAs: Consider turning your camera on or providing a visual for the customer to look at during the assessment. The <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/09i64wctd6ncdj988p16qs0tvsl9t6mi" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>slide deck</a> can be used to keep the conversation on track and remind the customer what you are on focusing on.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='GVA Best Practices'>

#### Doing this for first time ? Then ask for help.

If newer to conducting GVAs, donâ€™t fly solo. Have a fellow experienced Guardium CSM join you.

#### Follow Up

- Recurring progress checkpoint on GVA.
- Helps ensure timely progress on recommended actions.
- Low hanging fruit that can be completed quickly with big impact â€“ list first.
- Order the recommendations in a sequence that doesnâ€™t exude sales and revenue first.

#### Request to record the GVA if appropriate

- Request to record the Webex GVA discovery/survey meeting â€“ if appropriate, but not at the expense of the customer being very open.
- This might allow greater discovery insights, dialog, and more accurate data recording.

#### Know your audience

- Business partner
- Sometimes â€“ keep IBM attendees to just CSMs or Tech Sales

#### Keep an eye on the forms and deliverables

Know your forms and deliverables.
- Pre-GVA Survey/Spreadsheet â€“ Send to customer prior to GVA Workshop for generating GVA Snapshot.
- GVA Questionnaire spreadsheet form â€“ Do Not share with the customer.
- GVA Recommendations Library â€“ Make use of the relevant recommendations in the final deliverable form. Also, if any new recommendations identified, state them in this form.
- GVA customer deliverable â€“ do not use generic responses â€“ ensure all are suited and customized for your customer.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
