## CP4S Generation Evolution

One of the most important aspects of Cloud Pak for Security is to understand the distinction between the Cloud Pak for Security license and Cloud Pak for Security the product. When we refer to Cloud Pak for Security in conversations with clients, with support or amongst the CSM team it is not abundantly clear which is being referred to. This should help to clear up the confusion.

When CP4S was originally launched in 2019, there was only CP4S (the product) with a license that could only be used for that set of capabilities. This is known as CP4S Gen 1. The license and the product were essentially the same entity. This offering was built solely on OpenShift and included two capabilities; Data Explorer and SOAR/Breach Response. The intent was to target QRadar SIEM users with this augmented set of add on capabilities to enhance their SIEM.

A few months later, we introduced CP4S Gen 2. This is when flexible licensing was introduced where a license could be used for products regardless of platform. From Gen 2 onward, we now have to make the distinction between CP4S the license and CP4S the product. In Gen 2, we added new OpenShift platform supported capabilities for Threat Intelligence Insights. In addition, we introduced the option to apply the Gen 2 license to NON-OPENSHIFT Products. These products are QRadar SIEM, QRadar Data Store, and QRadar Flow Analytics. None of these products are supported on OpenShift but can be activated with the exact same license as the OpenShift supported products previously mentioned.

In Gen 3, we continued to allow clients to apply CP4S licenses to more and more OpenShift Native and NON-OpenShift Native solutions. In Gen 3, we added additional Native OpenShift Solution, Guardium Insights and Risk Manager. So, once we get to Gen 3, a client can apply the CP4S license to SOAR/Breach Response, Data Explorer, Threat Intelligence Insights, Threat Investigator, Risk Manager and Guardium Insights, all of which are OpenShift Native Solutions. In addition, a client could elect to use CP4S Gen 3 licenses for Non OpenShift Native Solutions; QRadar SIEM, QRadar Data Store, QRadar Flow Analytics, Guardium Data Protection or Guardium Vulnerability Assessment. A mixture of license usage across OpenShift and Non OpenShift solutions is reasonable and expected.

The next major change happened in July 2022 when CP4S Gen 3 was separated into the QRadar XDR Package and the Guardium Package. At this stage, the Security Brand began to deprecate the term “CP4S”. We also introduced a short-lived Verify Package which was quickly retired. In the package examples, we separated components not by platform but by segment and usage. Whereas Gen 3 allowed a client to use CP4S licenses for products in Threat Management and Digital Trust pillars, the new packages placed limitations on which products the licenses could be used for and limited them to pillars.

The Guardium Package contains Native OpenShift products SOAR/Breach Response, Risk Manager and Guardium Insights. It also allows the client to use the same license for Non-OpenShift products, Guardium Data Protection and Guardium Vulnerability Assessment. Once again, the license can be used to activate both OpenShift and Non-OpenShift solutions.

The QRadar XDR solution follows the same model. QRadar XDR Package license can be used for XDR Connect (formerly Data Explorer), SOAR/Breach Response and Risk Manager, Threat Intelligence Insights and Threat Investigator all of which are Native OpenShift. In addition, the same license can be used for QRadar SIEM, QRadar Data Store and QRadar Flow Analytics (NDR). All of which are Non-OpenShift solutions.

Verify Package was also introduced. This was a short-lived package which was quickly retired.

The most recent announcement for CP4S Licensing is the renaming of the QRadar XDR Package to QRadar Suite in May 2023. Licenses for QRadar Suite can be applied identically to the QRadar XDR Package from 2022. This is primarily a name change. In addition, no changes have been made to the Guardium Package so the two “CP4S” solutions currently available to clients are QRadar Suite and Guardium Package.

Going forward the concept of CP4S is being diminished in favor of product-led branding as evidenced by the “package” version releases in 2022 and beyond. “CP4S” can still be used to describe the Open Shift Native capabilities of the Security Portfolio but we should focus on the capabilities delivered instead.
