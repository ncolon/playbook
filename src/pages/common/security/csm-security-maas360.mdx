## What is MaaS360 and what does it do? <br/>

IBM Security MaaS360 with Watson protects devices, apps, content and data so you can rapidly scale your remote workforce and bring your own device (BYOD) initiatives, helping you build a zero trust strategy with modern device management. And with Watson, you take advantage of contextual analytics via Artificial Intelligence (AI) for actionable insights.

Features:

- **Manage and secure your remote workforce:** As flexible work models have become the new norm, employees must remain productive from everywhere, on any type of platform, in a safe way. IT administrators can quickly enroll and configure devices, manage identity and access, and integrate with Microsoft 365.
- **Manage and integrate your diverse endpoints:** Whether you're supporting iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Chrome OS or ruggedized devices and beyond to IoT, easily manage and protect your on-premises and remote corporate-owned and personal laptops, desktops, modern devices and more — all from a single console.
- **Reduce risk with layered mobile threat defense:** Provide seamless data access to users while you remotely manage threats such as phishing, mutating software, insider threats, and the potential vulnerabilities of cloud-based computing services.
- **Encrypt, edit and synchronize documents:** Enable users to more securely access, create, edit and sync business documents on their mobile devices. Managed documents can be version controlled, audited and secured through data loss prevention (DLP) and other policy options.

## What are the pain points that MaaS360 addresses?

**Pain point:** Need modern endpoint management designed for the “work from anywhere” workforce. IBM Security MaaS360 addresses this by supporting mobile device management (MDM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) functions. It has a unified application catalog and also supports MSFT HoloLens (MR), IoT, AR & VR devices along with Windows and Mac.

**Pain point:** Must enable frictionless anywhere-anytime digital-access-from-any-device employee experience. IBM Security MaaS360 allows over the air enrollment. It handles certificate distribution and SCEP integration. It also makes sure that all the policies and compliance rules are in place and provides network and VPN configuration, encryption support, jailbreak and root detection, app and OS compliance, and geofencing.

**Pain Point:** Defending an expanded attack surface from phishing, malware and other endpoint threats. IBM Security MaaS360 prevents data loss by featuring security containment of sensitive data and OS developer methods. It provides threat detection and remediation with real-time malware detection making use of Wandera’s MI:RIAM AI platform.

**Pain Point:** Not enough IT experts to deploy, secure and manage multiple platforms. IBM Security MaaS360 allows eco-system expansion of 3rd party apps. Along with that, it also provides integration with Microsoft eco-system for conditional access (including Azure AD, Microsoft365).

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmD929bHdcc28FCQj3p6MhTfgWd" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of MaaS360</a>. This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the MaaS360 and what is available in it.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

These are couple of example use cases covering different client stories using MaaS360. Check these <a href='https://www.ibm.com/products/maas360/case-studies' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>External Case Studies</a> for reference.

## How do I expand and grow MaaS360 usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of MaaS360. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>
Use the following conversation starters as references: <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCQdmDW6XWGMHGqTXhDMpcHGqbd3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM MaaS360 - Threat Management</a><br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCBcBWGq3J78pG4BfHJJQ3MTD9bP' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SalesLoft Cadence Guide for IBM MaaS360</a><br/><br/>

#### MaaS360 Value Assessment (MVA)

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title='What is a MVA ?'>

A no-fee, assessment of the current state of a customer's MaaS360 deployment that results in actionable recommendations to optimize their existing investment.  There are two ways to do a value assessment:

* A **Traditional MVA** (a 2-hour workshop in person or remote that leads to a report with a scorecard and custom recommendations)
* A **Digital MVA** (an 8-10 minute self-service survey that leads to a report with a scorecard)

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Why do you need a Value Assessment ?'>

* A value assessment helps the CSM to increase the usage and adoption through use case identification and value realization.
* It helps the CSM to better understand the customer’s endpoint management successes, challenges, and broader operations/security goals, as well as ensure they fully utilize the platform.
* This enables the CSM to have early conversations with the customers about renewing and expanding contracts, leading to greater license increase opportunities and easier renewals.

- Reaching deployment or approaching end of life
- New client team
- Actively opening tickets
- Licensing conversations

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='MVA Best Practices'>

#### Doing this for first time ? Then ask for help.

If newer to conducting MVAs, don’t fly solo. Have a fellow experienced MaaS360 CSM join you.

#### Follow Up

- Recurring progress checkpoint on MVA.
- Helps ensure timely progress on recommended actions.
- Low hanging fruit that can be completed quickly with big impact – list first.
- Order the recommendations in a sequence that doesn’t exude sales and revenue first.

#### Request to record the MVA if appropriate

- Request to record the Webex MVA discovery/survey meeting – if appropriate, but not at the expense of the customer being very open.
- This might allow greater discovery insights, dialog, and more accurate data recording.

#### Know your audience

- Business partner
- Sometimes – keep IBM attendees to just CSMs or Tech Sales

#### Keep an eye on the forms and deliverables

Know your forms and deliverables.
- MVA Questionnaire spreadsheet form – Do Not share with the customer.
- MVA customer deliverable – do not use generic responses – ensure all are suited and customized for your customer.

</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
