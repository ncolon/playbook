## What is IBM Cloud Pak for Security SaaS and what does it do? <br/>

IBM Cloud Pak for Security provides a platform to quickly integrate security tools and generate deeper insights into threats across hybrid, multicloud environments. The Cloud Pak for Security platform uses an infrastructure-independent common operating environment that can be installed and run anywhere. It comprises containerized software that is pre-integrated with **Red Hat OpenShift** Container Platform.

Cloud Pak for Security as a Service supported applications are as follows:

- IBM Security Data Explorer - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak® for Security on premises.
- IBM Security Threat Intelligence Insights - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak for Security on premises, except that you do not need to select a plan.
- IBM Security SOAR (Case Management and Orchestration & Automation) - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak for Security on premises.
- IBM QRadar Proxy - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak for Security on premises.
- IBM Security Risk Manager - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak for Security on premises.
- IBM Security Threat Investigator - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak for Security on premises.
- Detection and Response Center (Beta) - All features and capabilities as supported by IBM Cloud Pak for Security on premises.

## What are the pain points that Cloud Pak for Security SaaS addresses?

The key pain points that IBM Cloud Pak for Security SaaS addresses are related to the cost reduction and flexibility, such as:

**Pain Point:** Lack of visibility; security data spread across hybrid, multicloud environments. Cloud Pak for Security overcomes as it is built on open source tech and it is an open ecosystem. Also, it can be hosted on-premise as well on private, hybrid and public cloud.

**Pain Point:** Consolidating data is expensive and complicated. Cloud Pak for Security resolves this as the data movement is no longer required if we use it.

**Pain Point:** Point-to-point integrations are costly, and hard to manage. Cloud Pak for Security preserves investments by working with the current security tools in place. This reduces the effort and cost.

**Pain Point:** Insufficient skilled resources. Cloud Pak for Security resolves this by using IBM Security SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response). SOAR improves staff efficiency and also reduces the MTTR (Mean Time To Repair).

**Pain Point:** Siloed data in different places makes investigations difficult and time consuming. To avoid this, Cloud Pak for Security connects all data sources using pre-built integrations and open software development kit.

**Pain Point:** Different tools require different training and knowledge to use. Using Cloud Pak for Security will allow to search for treats across all the data sources, from a single interface using a common query language.

**Pain Point:** Too much time spent on manual and repetitive tasks. Cloud Pak for Security overcomes this by automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks. As a result, it reduces staff overload and burnout.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCVRXgQm8pHpg8FXmJJGjG76qWPP" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Cloud Pak for Security</a>.  This client facing deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the Cloud Pak for Security and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/slicusecase01' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Sri Lanka Insurance</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Vineet Srivastava) worked with them to to deploy an end to end security solution with CP4S - QRadar.

## How do I expand and grow Cloud Pak for Security SaaS usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM Cloud Pak for Security SaaS platform. Make them aware that IBM Cloud Pak for Security integrates with existing security tools quickly, and down the road the client can choose to simplify their stack by replacing certain components as desired with IBM offerings. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.

Use the following conversation starters as references:
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmXRMX7dXmQb8C2b8qd3848XJf3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Extend threat management protection</a>
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCV6hTgbXDTVP82P98Df4M9XCB3P' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Defend and Block Ransomware</a>
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCX99VJpcXVJ28WVRm7Gb2qX6X3G' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Why Change conversation guide</a>

We also have a bunch of case studies here in the <a href="https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' >Use Case Repository (deprecated)</a> and the <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STARS repository.</a><br/>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

Firstly determine, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/RDQK3Q9N" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Which security platform works best for you?</a>

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.

#### ![use-case](../images/use-case-14.svg) Use Cases

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title='Visibility'>

Visibility is a core Cloud Pak for Security use case. A key reason that organizations today are being breached with increasing frequency, and the effects of the breaches continue to escalate, is that they do not have the ability to gain visibility across their entire IT estate, from a single point, without incredibly expensive and complex data movement that does not provide real-time insights into their threat landscape.

Federated search and investigation is the heart of Cloud Pak for Security.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Response'>

After an issue has been identified, many organizations must manually create a response plan “on the fly,” which results in much longer remediation times and a much higher risk of system damage, data loss and even reputational and compliance issues. What is needed is a way to orchestrate and automate the incident response process through a set of pre-defined playbooks that cover major security issues like ransomware, advanced persistent threats, etc. A playbook allows the response team to define and practice the response plan prior to an issue, and when an issue does arise, they simply execute on the plan, or playbook. This is very similar to other emergency response organizations, which practice responding to incidents like earthquakes long before one occurs.

Cloud Pak for Security includes a response capability known as Cases, which provides basic case management and tracking capabilities.
