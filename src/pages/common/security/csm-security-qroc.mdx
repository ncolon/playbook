## What is QRadar on Cloud and what does it do? <br/>

**IBM QRadar on Cloud (QRoC)** is the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) version of QRadar SIEM. IBM QRadar SIEM enables your security analysts to quickly detect anomalies and attacks while eliminating many false positives. It is evolving beyond traditional SIEM technology to “intelligent security analytics” by adding context and insights from capabilities such as deep packet inspection, asset and vulnerability management, cloud visibility, user behavior analytics, and then applying advanced analytics including Watson artificial intelligence.

## What are the pain points that QRadar on Cloud addresses?

**Pain Point:** In today’s hyperconnected world, cyber criminals act with increasing agility and speed. So too must security teams. **IBM Security QRadar SIEM** helps teams meet the quick response challenge with automated, near-real-time threat detection.

**Pain Point:** As cyberattacks become more widespread, proof of cybersecurity compliance becomes increasingly important to clients and governing bodies. However, ensuring compliance often requires cybersecurity teams to act across complex sets of standards and regulations that differ by industry and country. To manage this, automation can help. **IBM Security QRadar SIEM** compliance solutions reduce vulnerabilities and help to manage complex compliance requirements by running your SIEM log data through compliance extension for most regulatory standards. It also delivers automatic compliance reporting against standards your organization needs to meet.

**Pain Point:** Detecting and responding to ransomware is challenging. Protecting your organization from ransomware and other types of malware requires a quick response, because with every passing second, more files are encrypted and more devices are infected—driving up both the damage and the cost. **IBM Security QRadar SIEM** helps you detect these threats rapidly, so you can take immediate, informed action to prevent or minimize the effects of the attack.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCXccHccT9C8m8HT6dpPX2dFqPfG" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of QRoC</a>.  This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security Guardium and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-1" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value (proof of experience (PoX)) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

These are couple of example use cases covering different client stories using IBM Security QRadar SIEM. Check these <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-siem" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Use Cases</a> for reference.

## How do I expand and grow QRadar on Cloud usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM QRadar on Cloud. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>
Use the following conversation starters as references: <br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC9FQ4g9f2gc6GcRh6GjgWdPQ4FP' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>QRoC</a><br/>

#### QRadar Value Assessment (QVA)

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title='What is a QVA ?'>

A no-fee, three-hour workshop with technical experts that will help assess the current state of your customer's QRadar deployment (On-Prem and On Cloud) and result in actionable recommendations to optimize their existing investment.

#### Assets

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Why do you need a Value Assessment ?'>

* A value assessment helps the CSM to increase the usage and adoption through use case identification and value realization.
* It helps the CSM to better understand the customer’s QRadar successes, challenges, and broader network security goals, as well as ensure they fully utilize the platform.
* This enables the CSM to have early conversations with the customers about renewing and expanding contracts, leading to greater license increase opportunities and easier renewals.

- For Virtual QVAs: Consider turning your camera on or providing a visual for the customer to look at during the assessment. This <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/sa8elun5pvy6tdzitjg19p6hwxeawtvt" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>slide deck</a> can be used to keep the conversation on track and remind the customer what you are focusing on.
#### Delivering a QVA Report
Once a QVA has been executed, use the following resources and templates to prepare a clean and targeted QVA Report.
- Use this template for the report – <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/i8iv9g9i6u47gwv6oqi8ib542gmqt7fz" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Template for QVA Report</a>

<AccordionItem title='Where to do a QVA ?'>

- QVA done > 1 year
- Low deployment %
- Reaching deployment or approaching end of life
- New client team
- Actively opening tickets
- Licensing conversations

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='QVA Best Practices'>

#### Doing this for first time ? Then ask for help.

If newer to conducting QVAs, don’t fly solo. Have a fellow experienced QRadar CSM join you.

#### Follow Up

- Recurring progress checkpoint on QVA.
- Helps ensure timely progress on recommended actions.
- Low hanging fruit that can be completed quickly with big impact – list first.
- Order the recommendations in a sequence that doesn’t exude sales and revenue first.

#### Request to record the QVA if appropriate

- Request to record the Webex QVA discovery/survey meeting – if appropriate, but not at the expense of the customer being very open.
- This might allow greater discovery insights, dialog, and more accurate data recording.

#### Know your audience

- Business partner
- Sometimes – keep IBM attendees to just CSMs or Tech Sales

#### Keep an eye on the forms and deliverables

Know your forms and deliverables.
- Log Source inventory – not for customers
- Other Log Source forms are for your benefit only and contain vendor product examples and use cases.
- QVA Discovery spreadsheet form – Do Not share with the customer
- QVA customer deliverable – do not use generic responses – ensure all are suited and customized for your customer.

</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
