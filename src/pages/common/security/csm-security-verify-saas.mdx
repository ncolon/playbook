## What is Verify ? What does it do? <br/>

## What are the pain points Verify addresses?

**Pain Point:** The pain points from a CISO/IT Security/IAM head perspective will be to meet industry compliance needs, adoption of zero trust strategy, cloud transformation, security incident and conflict management, reduce security risk, justify cost of security solutions, triaging false positives/alarms and appropriate risk response and remediation. IBM Security Verify addresses these pain points as it meets compliance mandates, gives fast time to value, low investment and also addresses consumer, employee, and privileged identity use cases.

**Pain Point:** The pain points from a CIO perspective will be digital transformation journey, frictionless experience for users, change management with introduction of new tech, reduce IT costs while modernizing applications and company-wide lack of technical knowledge. IBM Security Verify helps to overcome these pain points by providing seamless experience with a balance of security for users and integrating business applications without disruption.

**Pain Point:** The pain points from a developer perspective will be lack of time and resource, application maintenance, and increased security focus especially with shift to cloud application delivery of IAM systems. IBM Security Verify resolves this by leveraging IAM capabilities within application code, such as SSO, MFA, and DevOps Vault.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCBFWBMF8BDFM8WWh4B84HWBqFjV" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Security Verify SaaS</a>.  This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security Verify and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-2" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

## How do I expand and grow the usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM Security Verify. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>
Use the following conversation starters as references: <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCPpR4WhdQJchGfHd3HmcPTdWH73' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Security Verify - Conversation guide</a><br/><br/>

<AccordionItem title='Why do you need a Value Assessment ?'>

* A value assessment helps the CSM to increase the usage and adoption through use case identification and value realization.
* It helps the CSM to better understand the customer’s ISIM/IGI successes, challenges, and broader IAM security goals, as well as ensure they fully utilize the platform.
* This enables the CSM to have early conversations with the customers about renewing and expanding contracts, leading to greater license increase opportunities and easier renewals.

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.<br/>

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
