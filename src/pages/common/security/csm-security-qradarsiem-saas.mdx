**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QRadar SIEM (SaaS) SRE | QRadar SIEM (SaaS) SaaS instance provisioned and the customer has access. | The QRadar SIEM (SaaS) SaaS instance is not multi-tenant and one environment per customer. There is no trial for QRadar SIEM (SaaS) for customers to transition from a trial to paid service. The client will be required to create an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBMid account</a>. <br/><br/> **Option to a trial**<br/> 1. Log in to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/community/101/qradar/ce/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>QRadar CE page</a>. <br/> 2. Registered customers can download and install QRadar CE to experience QRadar functionality. This version is currently released on QRadar 7.3.3, but an open feature request for a 7.5.0 version is posted on IBM Ideas to release an updated version. <br/> 3. No guided tour is available, but advice is available on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/community/101/qradar/ce/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>QRadar CE page</a> for customers to download the free version and try out the functionality. **Note**: Entitled customers who have an S&S license can get a 30-day version of QRadar 7.5.0 by downloading the latest ISO from IBM Fix Central. |

### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QRadar SIEM (SaaS) SRE and CSM | Customer has validated access to their QRadar SIEM (SaaS) SaaS instance using their IBMid and added a target. | After the QRadar SIEM (SaaS) instance has been provisioned, a customer can access their instance URL from the email. <br/> By default, the IAM for the instance is configured with IBM Verify and using IBMid.  A customer can configure the instance to use a different access management system but will need to work with support. <br/><br/> If no activity has been taken by the client, an <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/nil1v27b0pa4ngsc86syogm20iygqicu" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Onboarding Nudge Email Template</a> can be sent with instructions to add a target. <br/><br/> After the onboarding process has been completed, a <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/3vk07v03zquu1i5yqa2c1dsc82dwfuei" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Onboarded Email Template</a> is available to advise the client to take the next step of their journey to take an action. |

### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM or Technology Expert Labs | Client has implemented actions that consume at least 10% of the purchased subscription capacity that must be in use to be receiving value and considered "deployed". | The image below captures the QRadar SIEM (SaaS) ARM Journey providing the customer with visibility of their on-prem, public Cloud and containerized environments, automated decisions that can be taken manually and ultimately, working towards allowing QRadar SIEM (SaaS) to take automated actions.

## Confirm Value & Expand

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Customer has realized value and expanding usage to new business units. | Set up an <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/executive-business-review/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>EBR (executive business review)</a> with the client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen and confirm the customer's strategic goals have been met. <br/><br/> A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services, look for opportunities to add more automation of actions, and try to expand the adoption with other business units.
