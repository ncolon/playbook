## What are the pain points that Guardium addresses?

**Pain Point:** Secure the sensitive or regulated data and meet compliance with regulations. ***IBM Security Guardium*** helps organizations achieve their data security and compliance goals through its broad portfolio of robust encryption, data activity monitoring, data threat analysis, and compliance reporting tools.

**Pain Point:** Securing data across hybrid multicloud environments. ***IBM Security Guardium Data Protection*** resolves this by supporting hybrid multicloud data protection with consistent data security policies across environments and holistic risk views. It provides broad platform support and massive scalability for the largest on-premise and cloud environments.

**Pain Point:** Encrypted data remains worthless ciphertext without access to encryption keys. But, developing encryption policies, managing the encryption environment and maintaining keys can be challenging. ***IBM Security Guardium Data Encryption*** resolves this by protecting assets residing in cloud, virtual, big data, and physical environments, offering capabilities to encrypt and control access to files, databases, and applications through a unified suite of encryption and key management capabilities for the hybrid multicloud environment.

**Pain Point:** Understanding where sensitive data resides, how it is used through out the organization, differentiating between types of sensitive data and maintaining visibility over this sensitive data is challenging. ***IBM Security Discover and Classify*** (ISDC) will help to address this problem by identifying repositories (databases, applications, file systems, log files, etc.) where sensitive data resides, and scan them to get full visibility into the depth and breadth of the data.

**Pain Point:** With changes in user privileges, roles or configurations and new versions or patches releasing regularly, many organizations lack the centralized visibility and control or skilled resources to review changes systematically to determine if they have introduced security gaps. ***IBM Guardium Vulnerability Assessment*** identifies weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors to access sensitive data. This eliminates enormous risk created by insecure data repository configurations, missing patches, weak passwords and other common vulnerability exposures (CVE’s) helping you better understand and then improve your data security posture.

**Pain Point:** Native, full-disk encryption generates large volumes of data-encryption keys, which must be protected and managed. Managing the security of diverse data storge devices can be burdensome. Also, encryption can limit availability of data and end-of-life of storage media can be expensive as well as slow. For all these demands, ***IBM Security Guardium Key Lifecycle Manager*** provides a centralized key management solution.

**Pain Point:** Determining business risks that are associated with information assets, identifying and prioritizing controls implementation is challenging. ***IBM Data Risk Manager*** addresses this by providing business leaders a business-consumable data risk control center that helps to uncover, analyze, and visualize data-related business risks. Business leaders can then proactively address data-related business risks to protect their organizations.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCpfWhbcCMRbH8CRdDgp8jG6cDXP" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Security Guardium</a>.  This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security Guardium and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-1" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value (proof of experience (PoX)) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/x9asukyilnxhloam1io0h73gv1vn98yd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Banco Central do Brasil</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Henderson Cerqueira) worked with them to use IBM Guardium Insights for increasing and improving visibility as well as monitoring of access to data and systems, in addition to meeting the Bank's LGPD standards.

## How do I expand and grow Guardium usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM Security Guardium platform. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>
Use the following conversation starters as references: <br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC79qqR8c24qQ89Fgbmf4BpJmmc8' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBM Security Guardium Data Protection</a><br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCTpFTWqQDjC6G9TbC6hGCD66Djd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Encryption Key Management (Guardium)</a><br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC2jM4Phchm9C84WPhD9fBCfV968' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Guardium for Key Management</a><br/><a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCTg2f3VBh9TC8qMqgDPqJfMBg8V' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Guardium for Files and Database Encryption</a><br/><br/>

<AccordionItem title='How to run a GVA Workshop ?'>

#### Executing a GVA Report
Once a GVA has been scheduled, consider the following steps in executing a successful and effective workshop.
1. Start with the <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/198964392246" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GVA Snapshot</a>. Send the customer a link to complete the <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/6561334/ibmgdr" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GVA Pre-Engagement Survey</a> or send them the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/sb2b4wywb6qwgrl498wvqdk3tg2ofan5" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>spreadsheet</a> of the questionnaire to go through together. This questionnaire will capture the details of the current state of their environment. If using the online survey tool, you can receive a code from <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/#/people/1J4179897" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tiana Sullivan</a> or <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/#/people/1J2400897" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Ashish John</a> as well as the survey results.
2. If the customer would like to get a deeper technical understanding of their Guardium environment, do the full GVA workshop. Utilize the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/ge3v6ocrq71z9p25g447b4k3uj9ddssw" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>GVA Questionnaire</a> to guide your conversation, break the question set down into focused segments, and record the customer’s responses and comments.
3. For virtual GVAs: Consider turning your camera on or providing a visual for the customer to look at during the assessment. The <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/09i64wctd6ncdj988p16qs0tvsl9t6mi" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>slide deck</a> can be used to keep the conversation on track and remind the customer what you are on focusing on.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='GVA Best Practices'>

#### Doing this for first time ? Then ask for help.

If newer to conducting GVAs, don’t fly solo. Have a fellow experienced Guardium CSM join you.

#### Follow Up

- Recurring progress checkpoint on GVA.
- Helps ensure timely progress on recommended actions.
- Low hanging fruit that can be completed quickly with big impact – list first.
- Order the recommendations in a sequence that doesn’t exude sales and revenue first.

#### Request to record the GVA if appropriate

- Request to record the Webex GVA discovery/survey meeting – if appropriate, but not at the expense of the customer being very open.
- This might allow greater discovery insights, dialog, and more accurate data recording.

#### Know your audience

- Business partner
- Sometimes – keep IBM attendees to just CSMs or Tech Sales

#### Keep an eye on the forms and deliverables

Know your forms and deliverables.
- Pre-GVA Survey/Spreadsheet – Send to customer prior to GVA Workshop for generating GVA Snapshot.
- GVA Questionnaire spreadsheet form – Do Not share with the customer.
- GVA Recommendations Library – Make use of the relevant recommendations in the final deliverable form. Also, if any new recommendations identified, state them in this form.
- GVA customer deliverable – do not use generic responses – ensure all are suited and customized for your customer.

</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
