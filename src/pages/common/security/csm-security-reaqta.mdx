## What is ReaQta and what does it do? <br/>

** IBM Security ReaQta** is AI-powered, automated endpoint security that provides traditional endpoint security, including antivirus and signature-based protection, may not be enough. And yet, as seen through the rise of eXtended Detection and Response (XDR), endpoints are critical to broader visibility across the enterprise, whether in cloud, on servers or elsewhere. With XDR here to stay, endpoint security should evolve to keep pace.

ReaQta leverages exceptional levels of intelligent automation and AI to help detect and remediate known and unknown threats in near real time. With deep visibility across endpoints, it combines expected features, such as MITRE ATT&CK mapping and attack visualizations, with dual-engine AI and automation to propel endpoint security into a zero trust world.

## What are the pain points that ReaQta addresses?

**Pain Point:** A rise in and complexity of malicious and automated cyber activity, most of which targets the endpoint. Exponentially more endpoints outside of the corporate Firewall. ReaQta uses automated, AI - powered threat detection. This is driven by 70+ customizable behavioral models deployed at the endpoint for detection and granular search. Also, advanced behavioral analytics allows for continual improvement and tailored detection.

**Pain Point:** Traditional approaches rely on finding what’s known (known signatures), but attackers target unknown (fileless/ransomware). To avoid this, ReaQta uses AI, enabling organizations to no longer rely on rules & signatures (antivirus solutions) to detect cyber threats, in a constantly evolving threat landscape.

**Pain Point:** Poor visibility, Zero-day attacks and need for real-time detection and response. ReaQta can remediate in real-time with guided or autonomous actions.

**Pain Point:** Attackers “living off the land” (manipulating legitimate software and files to disguise their presence). ReaQta is equally effective on malware (ransomware, RAT, trojans, etc.) and non-malware (fileless, in-memory) attacks. It will be able to identify the underlying attack and help detect it.

**Pain Point:** Inexperienced, new and fatigued analysts who struggle with complex tooling, alert overload and heavy demand. ReaQta provides round-the-clock security, easily augmenting organizations’ cyber protection capabilities without the hassle of training and hiring new personnel.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC7Hjff7HTbJq8m29B3XqQVd4WFV" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of ReaQta</a>. This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security ReaQta and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-5" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

These are couple of example use cases covering different client stories using ReaQta. Have a look at <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCzqJwZ7ap00KeFzip211jsg' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Security Win Wires</a>.

Below are few case studies:

## How do I expand and grow ReaQta usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM ReaQta. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.

Use the following conversation starters as references:
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCWP2bFh8pHPPGFPMD8WcJ46BJjd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>ReaQta Conversation Guide</a>
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGG2dWPTP7DD8qW2JpF9bGRJ29d' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Integration Conversation Guide</a>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are some where on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
