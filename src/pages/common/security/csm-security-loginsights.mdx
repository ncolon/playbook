## What is QRadar Log Insights and what does it do? <br/>

**IBM QRadar Log Insights** is a cloud-native log management and security observability solution providing simplified data ingestion, sub-second search and rapid analytics. It leverages an elastic security data lake optimized to collect, store and perform analytics on terabytes of data with greater speed and efficiency. It is designed for cost effective security log management alongside federated search and investigation.

## What are the pain points that QRadar Log Insights addresses?

**Pain Point:** Organizations lack the staff and expertise to support the deployment and operation of a SIEM solution. ***IBM Security QRadar Log Insights*** is more than a log manager helping us to investigate, analyze, and respond to threats.

**Pain Point:** Customers are seeking efficient storage, fast search and flexible visualization to support the investigation and analysis of security incidents and support threat-hunting requirements. ***IBM Security QRadar Log Insights*** intelligently detect threats to respond fast and reduce time spent on incidents with AI-infused investigations and lightning-fast searches on terabytes of data.

**Pain Point:** Customers are looking for less-complex, less-expensive options that support some SIEM use cases. ***IBM Security QRadar Log Insights*** avoids surprise overage fees with simple and predictable pricing.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC8QMJV9gXTVdGQPgBpBXhG97mDV" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Security QRadar Log Insights</a>.  This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security QRadar Log Insights and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-1" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value (proof of experience (PoX)) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

This is an example use case covering one client story using Log Insights. You can access it <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCDH94h6j7CV9GWPHJDdgB4HFRP3' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a>.

## How do I expand and grow QRadar Log Insights usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM QRadar Log Insights software. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>
We also have a bunch of case studies here in the <a href="https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' >Use Case Repository (deprecated)</a> and the <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STARS repository.</a><br/><br/>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
