**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  MaaS360 Sales Rep, IBM Business Partner | MaaS360 portal is provisioned on a MaaS360 cloud instance and the primary administrator is provided portal access. MaaS360 has multiple cloud instances across geographies. A customer portal is provisioned on one of these <a href='https://status.maas360.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>instances</a> based on the customer’s geo. Instances can be found here: <a href='https://status.maas360.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://status.maas360.com/</a>. The portal is ready for configuration. | There are different paths for a customer to request a MaaS360 trial and/or paid instance. The client is required to create an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBMid account</a> to subscribe to a 30-day trial. Portals created by IBM Business Partners such as Verizon are not required to have an IBMid account, a local MaaS360 administrator is created and the Administrator is prompted on first login to create and link to an IBMid, but this is not required. <br /><br/>**Trial** <br/> Request a 30-day free trial instance from a 3PM or ibm.com: <a href='https://www.ibm.com/products/maas360/pricing' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://www.ibm.com/products/maas360/pricing</a>. ![MaaS360 SaaS Post-Sales Journey](../images/maas360_saas_trial.png) <br/><br/>**Moving from a trial to paid** <br/> There are two ways a portal becomes a Customer (Paid) portal:<br/> 1. The portal is provisioned automatically through 3PM/ibm.com/BPQTO process with the placement of the order<br/> 2. A Trial portal is created, and the portal number is provided in the provisioning form when the order is placed in SQO and released.<br/> <br/>MaaS360 Administrator receives an email from MaaS360 instance with portal login credentials. A <a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/wvpoyq25wg4e3k5pzddvclcz2zmwm20q' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Welcome Email</a> is automatically sent from Gainsight to newly signed North America and EMEA customers once the SSABL entitlement is added to Gainsight. |

Set-up services are provided by the Deployment Technical Specialist team. | The customer MaaS360 Administrator logged into the portal and completed portal configuration to ready the portal to deploy licenses to end-user devices through device enrollment. <br/><br/> For CSM-assigned accounts, It’s the CSM’s responsibility to work with the customer to ensure Security policies align with an initial use case and a small, controlled deployment to end-user devices is completed, CSMs should jointly develop a Success plan with the customer and engage services as needed. <br/><br/> Automated Email Outreach for non-CSM assigned accounts is sent to North American and EMEA customers to monitor onboarding.<br/><br/>Webinars are provided for ALL onboarding customers. New customer/admin workshops: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/margaret-radford/2020/07/30/sign-up-here-for-maas360-new-customeradmin-worksho |


### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM, IBM Business Partners | The CSM should monitor the deployment phase and begin exploring additional use cases. The time-to-value goal is to reach 50% license usage in this phase. <br/> Deployment consists of assigning licenses to the end user device which will require end users to bring their own device (BYOD) to enroll the device in MaaS360 or for company-owned devices the Administrator can initiate/streamline the enrollment. | Automated Email Outreach for non-CSM assigned accounts is sent to North American and EMEA customers to monitor onboarding. <br/><br/> North America and CSM-assigned accounts will receive automated outreaches at 180 days. <br/><br/> **From signing** <br/> Webinars are provided for deploying customers: <a href='https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/margaret-radford/2020/01/21/introducing-maas360-health-check-webinars' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Deployment Checkpoint Webinar</a>. <br/><br/> **Technology Expert Labs Offerings:**<br/> **IBM Expert Labs Assess MaaS360** - Conducts an assessment of an IBM Security MaaS360 deployment against use cases, future goals, industry best practices and zero-trust IT security approaches. <br/> **IBM Expert Labs Configure MaaS360** - Setup service that provides an IBM professional services consultant's time that can be used for activities related to an IBM MaaS360 product deployment effort. <br/> **IBM MaaS360 Customer Setup per Engagement** - Setup service that provides an IBM professional services consultant's time that can be used for activities related to an IBM MaaS360 product deployment effort. <br/> **IBM MaaS360 Expert Assistance Service 20 Hours** - Provides an IBM professional services consultant's time that can be used for activities related to an IBM MaaS360 product deployment effort. <br/><br/> When the client has successfully taken an action, a <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/hb6rj3uziesqus03vok5sxil34q65auk" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Deployed Email Template</a> can be sent to guide setting up automation in the environment. |

### Confirm Value & Expand

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Customer has realized value and is expanding usage to new business units or initiating new use cases. | Set up an <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/executive-business-review/"  target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>EBR (executive business review)</a> with client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen and confirm the customer’s strategic goals have been met. A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services and look for opportunities to add more Unified Endpoint Management and Security use cases. <br/><br/>Automated outreaches are sent to both North America and EMEA CSM-assigned and non-CSM-assigned accounts. CSM-assigned accounts receive a subset of the outreaches. <br/><br/>  - The latest monthly technical touchpoints can be found here on the MaaS360 Customer Success Hub: <a href="https://ibm.biz/maas360csm" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://ibm.biz/maas360csm</a>. <br/> - All North America and EMEA customers are invited to bimonthly <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/margaret-radford/2023/08/10/join-an-upcoming-bi-monthly-ask-me-anything" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Ask me Anything</a> calls. | 

### Renewed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM, IBM Subscription Annuity Rep, IBM Business Partner | The client has confirmed that they are using the product and will continue to renew their entitlement. | **MaaS360 eNurture program** <br/> MaaS360 has a mature automated outreach program that runs in Gainsight. Email outreach and call-to-actions are sent throughout the customer journey. The following is a guide to the current <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/mpii65ujozqwy0n90z998qkxrhz1nxde" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>eNurture program</a>. <br/> Any North America or EMEA MaaS360 customer who has a contact(s) in the People section of the R360 with an assigned  IBM Customer Number and the OK to Email flag set to True will receive eNurture emails. <br /><br/> **IMPORTANT**: <br /> Ensure any contact you add manually or update has the correct IBM Customer Number (ICN) assigned to it and an accurate first and last name. In some cases, Gainsight creates a MaaS360 Relationship with multiple customers. For example, a conglomerate can have multiple distinct subsidiaries each having their own unique MaaS360 portal deployment. For the eNurture email to display the correct account information you must assign the correct ICN to the contact. <br/><br/> The OK to Email flag is set to True by default. If you want to remove the contact from eNurture set the flag to False. |
