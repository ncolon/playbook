**Note: The <i>AUTOMATED</i> deployment metrics are pending sign-off and should be considered in progress until this notice is removed.**

The following considerations should be taken when reporting on SaaS deployments:
- All deployments for SaaS should follow the same process as non-SaaS / on-prem deployments
- Create one Growth Plan per use case
- Growth Plan project stages will be used to determine milestone status
- Deployed growth plans require a success plan review by a manager before being counted in the CSM scorecard
- All 3 deployment questions must be answered for the Growth Plan before being counted in the CSM scorecard

### Provisioned

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provisioning team (SRE) | Randori portal is provisioned on a Randori cloud instance and the primary administrator is provided portal access. Randori has multiple cloud instances across geographies. A customer portal is provisioned on one of these <a href='https://status.Randori.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>instances</a> based on the customer’s geo. Instances can be found here: <a href='https://status.Randori.com/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://status.Randori.com/</a>. The portal is ready for configuration. | There are different paths for a customer to request a Randori trial and/or paid instance. The client is required to create an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IBMid account</a> to subscribe to a 30-day trial. Portals created by IBM Business Partners such as Verizon are not required to have an IBMid account, a local Randori administrator is created and the Administrator is prompted on the first login to create and link to an IBMid, but this is not required. <br /><br/>**Trial**<br/>Request a free trial instance from a 3PM or ibm.com: <a href='https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52370' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>7-day trial offer for potential customers</a>. |

### Onboarded

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM or Technology Expert Labs | CSM walks customers through personalized onboarding and initial training. After onboarding is complete, sessions are set up as monthly or bi-monthly success check-ins. |The customer Randori Administrator logged into the portal and completed portal configuration to ready the portal to deploy licenses to end-user devices through device enrollment. For CSM-assigned accounts, It’s the CSM’s responsibility to work with the customer to ensure Security policies align with an initial use case and a small, controlled deployment to end-user devices is completed, CSMs should jointly develop a success plan with the customer and engage services as needed. <br /><br/>**Onboarding process:** <br/>1. Kickoff (week 0) - Introductions, key design decisions, and goals outlined.<br/>2. Platform training (week 1) - Training on the Randori Platform.<br/>3. Use case training (week 2) - Workflows, vulnerability prioritization, automated actions.<br/>4. Implementation planning (week 3 & 4) - Goal review, operational review, integration discussions. <br/>5. Ongoing success (Month 2+) - Ongoing working session with the customer. |

### Deployed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM, IBM Business Partners | The CSM should monitor the deployment phase and begin exploring additional use cases. As CSMs successfully complete the onboarding goals, they can confirm the customer is deployed and using the product. As no consumption model exists at this time and Randori licenses are based on license count, users might be required to have a manager mark the customer as deployed. |   CSMs are expected to review and complete the health checklist before marking customers as deployed: <a href='https://ibm.box.com/s/mvd9h89d8ndpjppw44gac0ntlz4sr6ul' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Recon Health Checklist</a>. <br/><br/>**Technology Expert Labs Offerings:** <br/> TBD |

### Confirm Value & Expand

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM | Customer has realized value and expanding usage to new business units or initiating new use cases. | Set up an <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/csm-playbook/playbook/onboard/executive-business-review/"  target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>EBR (executive business review)</a> with client sponsor and executives to align and review the adoption, value seen and confirm the customer’s strategic goals have been met. A CSM should continue to drive usage of Technology Expert Labs services and look for opportunities to add more Unified Endpoint Management and Security use cases. Automated outreaches are sent to both North America and EMEA CSM-assigned and non-CSM-assigned accounts. CSM-assigned accounts receive a subset of the outreaches. <br/><br/> Customers <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/3hw63ynl8hf0ed2t8pkyp60b266ftdgt/file/1367417072594" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>are contacted</a> with a template before an EBR and reach out to the customer to discuss the continued partnership. |

### Renewed

| **Led by** | **Outcome** | **Assets & Activities** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSM, IBM Subscription Annuity Rep, IBM Business Partner | The client has confirmed that they are using the product and will continue to renew their entitlement. | **Randori eNurture program** <br/>Randori has a robust outreach program with follow-ups from CSMs. Email outreaches and calls-to-action are sent throughout the customer journey. |
