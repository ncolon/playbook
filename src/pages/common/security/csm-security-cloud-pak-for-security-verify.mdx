## What are the pain points that Cloud Pak for Security Verify Solution addresses?

The key pain points that IBM Cloud Pak for Security addresses are related to the cost reduction and flexibility, such as:

**Pain Point:** The pain points from a CISO/IT Security/IAM head perspective will be to meet industry compliance needs, adoption of zero trust strategy, cloud transformation, security incident and conflict management, reduce security risk, justify cost of security solutions, triaging false positives/alarms and appropriate risk response and remediation. IBM Security Verify addresses these pain points as it meets compliance mandates, gives fast time to value, low investment and also addresses consumer, employee, and privileged identity use cases.

**Pain Point:** The pain points from a CIO perspective will be digital transformation journey, frictionless experience for users, change management with introduction of new tech, reduce IT costs while modernizing applications and company-wide lack of technical knowledge. IBM Security Verify helps to overcome these pain points by providing seamless experience with a balance of security for users and integrating business applications without disruption.

**Pain Point:** The pain points from a developer perspective will be lack of time and resource, application maintenance, and increased security focus especially with shift to cloud application delivery of IAM systems. IBM Security Verify resolves this by leveraging IAM capabilities within application code, such as SSO, MFA, and DevOps Vault.

**Pain point:** New business initiatives to improve profitability performance for line of business applications. IBM Trusteer helps organizations quickly and transparently establish digital identity trust. This can allow companies to create a more seamless customer experience without compromising on security.

**Pain point:** Customers struggle with complex login authentication and identity challenges to access their digital accounts. Account related fraud is impacting support teams. Trusteer Pinpoint Assure fights unknown user fraud and seamlessly assess the identity risk of new and guest digital identities.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCVRXgQm8pHpg8FXmJJGjG76qWPP" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of IBM Cloud Pak for Security</a>.  This client facing deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the Cloud Pak for Security and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value (proof of experience (PoX)) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

These are couple of example use cases covering different client stories using IBM Cloud Pak for Security. Have a look at <a href='https://bit.ly/3jQapyM' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Client Success Central</a> and <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCzqJwZ7ap00KeFzip211jsg' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Security Win Wires</a>.

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/ozg1huh7n8vy2vnujv0vhn45l7u78y57' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>ANZ Bank</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Miranda Song) worked with them to implement the Trusteer Pinpoint Detect solution.

## How do I expand and grow Cloud Pak for Security usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM Cloud Pak for Security platform. Make them aware that IBM Cloud Pak for Security integrates with existing security tools quickly, and down the road the client can choose to simplify their stack by replacing certain components as desired with IBM offerings. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.

Use the following conversation starters as references:

* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCX99VJpcXVJ28WVRm7Gb2qX6X3G' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Why Change conversation guide</a>

We also have a bunch of case studies here in the <a href="https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' >Use Case Repository (deprecated)</a> and the <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STARS repository.</a><br/>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

Firstly determine, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/RDQK3Q9N" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Which security platform works best for you?</a>

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.

#### ![use-case](../images/use-case-14.svg) Use Cases

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title='Visibility'>

Visibility is a core Cloud Pak for Security use case. A key reason that organizations today are being breached with increasing frequency, and the effects of the breaches continue to escalate, is that they do not have the ability to gain visibility across their entire IT estate, from a single point, without incredibly expensive and complex data movement that does not provide real-time insights into their threat landscape.

Federated search and investigation is the heart of Cloud Pak for Security.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Response'>

After an issue has been identified, many organizations must manually create a response plan “on the fly,” which results in much longer remediation times and a much higher risk of system damage, data loss and even reputational and compliance issues. What is needed is a way to orchestrate and automate the incident response process through a set of pre-defined playbooks that cover major security issues like ransomware, advanced persistent threats, etc. A playbook allows the response team to define and practice the response plan prior to an issue, and when an issue does arise, they simply execute on the plan, or playbook. This is very similar to other emergency response organizations, which practice responding to incidents like earthquakes long before one occurs.

Cloud Pak for Security includes a response capability known as Cases, which provides basic case management and tracking capabilities.
