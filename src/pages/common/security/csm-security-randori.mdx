## What is Randori and what does it do? <br/>

**IBM Security Randori Recon** is a provider of Attack Surface Management (ASM) and Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART) capabilities via a SaaS based platform and services. Attack Surface Management (ASM) is an emerging market, and Randori offers IBM Security an opportunity to competitively differentiate and lead. The attack surface is a growing concern to many organizations as their digital footprint is growing rapidly across ever expanding cloud assets.

## What are the pain points that Randori addresses?

**Pain Point:** Security effectiveness and risk prioritization. Randori helps to identify and prioritize risks as well generates evidence of progress against strategic initiatives. Along with this, it also provides external insight for team development (Blue/Red Conversations) and "Insight/Proof" to justify security spend.

**Pain Point:** Prioritization and gap identification. To avoid gaps and identify them, Randori uses Recon to ensure they have full view of the attack surface. It also uses target temptation to inform prioritization process and use Randori "Insight/Proof" to justify priority to IT and security leaders.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCJ7ghPFXp7WQ8HBC8bXdfqc944d" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of Randori</a>.  This deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the IBM Security Randori and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-6" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

These are couple of example use cases covering different client stories using Randori. You can access them <a href='https://www.randori.com/case-studies/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a>.

Have a look at <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCzqJwZ7ap00KeFzip211jsg' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Security Win Wires</a>.

## How do I expand and grow Randori usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of IBM Randori. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.

Use the following conversation starters as references:
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCCMjCBfBMqPC8WWb8cdjj9GP8mP' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Security Hygiene and Posture Management Survey - Key Findings</a>
* <a href='https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChcCfFhMcjpM8FWF9dHC8hCTJqd' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Implement a Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) Program</a>

We also have a bunch of case studies here in the <a href="https://csm-usecase.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' >Use Case Repository (deprecated)</a> and the <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STARS repository.</a><br/>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are some where on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering, or Security Technology Expert Labs.
