## What is QRadar? What does it do?<br/>

**IBM Security QRadar XDR** is the industry's leading Extended Detection and Response(XDR) suite that helps to detect and eliminate threats faster. It helps security teams prioritize the most relevant threats to the business by providing detailed actionable threat investigations. It is a comprehensive solution that integrates data collected from assets, clouds, networks, endpoints and users and then correlates this data with vulnerability information and threat intelligence. It also performs advanced analytics to identify and track the most serious issues.

This suite also integrates with third-party security solutions. All the threat intel comes from IBM X-Force. The IBM X-Force platform facilitates the sharing of security threats research, intelligence aggregation, and peer collaboration. The full QRadar XDR suite gives complete visibility across data sources from a single interface.

QRadar XDR includes:

- **QRadar® XDR (Extended Detection and Response) Connect:** Connects tools, automate your SOC and streamline workflows.
- **QRadar® EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):** Automatically detects and stop threats such as ransomware.
- **QRadar® NDR (Network detection and response):** Detect hidden threats on your network.
- **QRadar® SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Intelligent security analytics for actionable insight into the most critical threats.
- **QRadar® SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response):** Respond to security incidents with confidence, consistency, and collaboration.
- **Threat Intel:** Advanced real-world, real-time industry curated Cyber intelligence.

## What are the pain points QRadar address?

The key pain points that QRadar addresses are related to the cost reduction and flexibility, such as:

**Pain Point:** Incumbent security tools not detecting critical issues and QRadar Extended Detection and Response overcomes this by superior data acquistion and using analytics to detect issues in real time.

**Pain Point:** Lack of visibility; security data spread across on-premise and cloud environments. By enabling integrations, this can be resolved. QRadar Extended Detection and Response comes with 600+ data integrations inclusing on-premise and cloud helping avoid this problem.

**Pain Point:** Total cost of ownership of current security stack too high. QRadar Extended Detection and Response supports native and hybrid XDR. This does not require any vendor lock-in and thus can reduce the spendings on security Extended Detection and Response.

**Pain Point:** Insufficient skilled resources and staff burnout. QRadar Extended Detection and Response reduces this by increasing analyst efficiency by using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, reducing MTTR (Mean Time To Repair). It drastically reduces the number of alerts and the time required to conduct investigations.

**Pain Point:** Too many alerts result in alert fatigue, reducing productivity, slowing response times and craeting staff burn out. QRadar helps the analyst to concentrate on most importtant things by providing the initial investigations using analytics.

**Pain Point:** Lack of cohesive incident response plans and processes. QRadar makes this easy by seemlessly integrating with both IBM and third party Extended Detection and Response tools including Splunk.

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

**Identify a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above or a Client Engineering engagement to identify use cases and sponsors.<br/><br/>
**Demonstrate how a given pain point can be addressed (demo) in the use case**<br/> Help your customers understand <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DChWbbCDWgqB88TVFF4dGh9XB8fj" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>the value of QRadar XDR</a>.  This client facing deck makes it really clear what capabilities are unique to the QRadar XDR and what is available in it. Also, make use of the <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/security-live-demos-collection#tab-4" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tech Zone - Security Live Demos Collection</a>.<br/><br/>
**Prove value  (proof of experience (PoX) of the use case**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect the product to the customers' systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.<br/><br/>
**Implement a project**<br/>
CSMs can work with the customer to determine how the customer would like to implement their project. Initially, there should be a conversation between Security Technology Expert Labs, yourself, and the client to scope the opportunity and engage our most qualified team. The customer may elect to utilize an implementation partner and/or do the work themselves. Regardless of how the deployment is conducted, ensure that you are involved in the process, keeping close contact with the teams and maintaining a proactive relationship with the client. Please pay close attention to the  <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/pps-shortcuts/sel-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>SEL Offerings</a> as a guideline for any deployment conversations with the client.

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

<a href='https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/8cdl3xpifea4scojdsuh1og1b4tkwi9w' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Incedo</a> is an example of a CSM driven engagement, where the CSM (Vineet Srivastava) worked with them to deploy QRadar SIEM over AWS infrastructure and complete the onboarding of their first client to start with post SIEM Implementation and eventually SOAR Implementation as well.

## How do I expand and grow the usage?

Start by showing the customer the value of Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform. Make them aware that QRadar XDR provides a great solution here as IBM can deploy XDR using the client’s existing technology stack, and down the road the client can choose to simplify their stack by replacing certain XDR components with IBM. As part of this implementation, look for opportunities as to how we can expand the usage of other security offerings in the engagement.<br/><br/>

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Where to do a QVA ?'>

- QVA done > 1 year
- Low deployment %
- Reaching deployment or approaching end of life
- New client team
- Actively opening tickets
- Licensing conversations

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='QVA Best Practices'>

#### Doing this for first time ? Then ask for help.

If newer to conducting QVAs, don’t fly solo. Have a fellow experienced QRadar CSM join you.

#### Follow Up

- Recurring progress checkpoint on QVA.
- Helps ensure timely progress on recommended actions.
- Low hanging fruit that can be completed quickly with big impact – list first.
- Order the recommendations in a sequence that doesn’t exude sales and revenue first.

#### Request to record the QVA if appropriate

- Request to record the Webex QVA discovery/survey meeting – if appropriate, but not at the expense of the customer being very open.
- This might allow greater discovery insights, dialog, and more accurate data recording.

#### Know your audience

- Business partner
- Sometimes – keep IBM attendees to just CSMs or Tech Sales

#### Keep an eye on the forms and deliverables

Know your forms and deliverables.
- Log Source inventory – not for customers
- Other Log Source forms are for your benefit only and contain vendor product examples and use cases.
- QVA Discovery spreadsheet form – Do Not share with the customer
- QVA customer deliverable – do not use generic responses – ensure all are suited and customized for your customer.

</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

Most customers are somewhere on their security journey and if you talk to the right people you will find the pain points that are listed above.

As a CSM, drive to at least gain approval from the customer to run a discovery workshop to identify and prioritize use cases and potential solution designs. Do this with the participation of IT and LOB in the room or MURAL session at the same time. If you need assistance running a workshop reach out the Practice Leaders, Greg Sabatini or Hemankita Perabathini for assistance. You can also ask to have Client Engineering or Security Technology Expert Labs run a session.

* **What can I do if a customer will lose their QRadar license coverage due to clerical error, partner mistake or oversight?**

Send a message to q1pd@us.ibm.com with the name of the customer, and current entitlements (EPS/FPM) requesting a temporary license. They will need to have details about the deployment but can let him know exactly what is needed. Please copy @GREG SABATINI and @Sterling on the email and we can provide additional context if they need it. The Q1PD team is responsible for existing customers.
