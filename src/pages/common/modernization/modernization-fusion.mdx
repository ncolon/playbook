## Scope
IBM Storage Fusion brings an agile, secure, resilient and highly performant data service foundation for container-based application workloads.  It eases the "Cloud Native" journey with Red Hat OpenShift by bringing enterprise-grade functionality and qualities of service to any hybrid multi-cloud environment.
It provides a consistent experience across all deployment platforms from HCI (hyper converged infrastructure), bare-metal, virtualized and public Cloud.

## Why should a customer modernize?
Clients have likely already started thinking about or already in the process of modernizing their application workload to be cloud-native.  Traditional storage infrastructure cannot keep pace with the rapid innovation and there is a need for a container-enabled enterprise storage platform that deploys seamlessly across hybrid infrastructure, provides a consistent user experience and delivers a performant and reliable platform with enterprise readiness.

IBM Storage Fusion is a software defined infrastructure for OpenShift.  It provides:
- Elastic infrastructure
  - Scales up and down with workload
  - Runs on any hardware on/off cloud (bare-metal)
  - Abstraction of infrastructure as code for DevOps<br/>

- Cloud Native Storage Services
    - File, Block and Object
    - Data Mobility / Isolation
    - Better performance at Scale

- Automated Backup and Restore
    - Consumed as policies with application consistency
    - Open Source compliant

- High Availability and Disaster Recovery

- Unstructured Data Analytics

It supports any OpenShift application and a Fusion Starter is included with all Cloud Paks.
