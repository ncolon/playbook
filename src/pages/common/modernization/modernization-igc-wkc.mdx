## Scope
IGC/IKC modernization is the process of taking customers from **IBM InfoSphere® Information Governance Catalog (IGC) and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA)** and moving them to IBM Knowledge Catalog running on Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShift. You can learn more about IBM Knowledge Catalog on our [playbook page](/data-ai/csm-data-ai-watson-knowledge-catalog)

## Modernization Conversations
While we have largely achieved functional parity with **IBM InfoSphere® Information Governance Catalog (IGC)and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA)** with the release of IKC on Cloud Pak for Data 4.8, CSMs and Account Teams should be very deliberate in how and when to have these conversations with clients. <br/><br/>

**What’s the risk?** <br/>
In addition to the functional gaps we closed with Cloud Pak for Data 4.7, we also introduced a set of semi-automated migration tools to assist clients who deployed the XMETA-based components that were part of IKC. These tools help clients get from older versions of IKC to IKC  4.7, but they did not support the semi-automated migration from IGC/IA to IKC. These tools have been enhanced throughout 2H23 and will support IGC/IA migration to Cloud Pak for Data with the release of 4.8. <br/><br/>

**Is Information Server reaching end of life?** <br/>
No. While it's true our investment in data movement, transformation and governance is focused on IKC and IKC on Cloud Pak for Data, there are no imminent plans to end support for Information Server. If it's working for clients, they can continue to run this environment and be confident they will continue to receive support. <br/><br/>

**What about this Free Migration Assessment?** <br/>
Its true! Expert Labs has developed a free migration assessment. The data collection part of the assessment can be useful to help plan for the eventual migration <br/><br/>

**So what should I do?** <br/>
- Engage with your client now.  Understand their current IGC deployment and what problems or upcoming use cases they need to address.
- Plan an account strategy for 1H24.  Where are they going?  What unmet needs do they currently have?  Are the blind spots in their data estate they want to address?
- Position IKC to address new use cases.  Don't start with a modernization play.  Start with a strategy to deploy IKC to address the new use cases.  Start small.
- Plan the modernization.  2024 will be here soon.  After successfully deploying that first IKC use case, what's next?  Are there other gaps or is it time to plan a modernization discussion?

### Why should a customer modernize?
IBM Cloud Pak for Data and IBM Knowledge Catalog provides customers with the next generation of IBM InfoSphere® Information Governance Catalog (IGC) and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA) and includes the following benefits:
- *Consume and extract value from more data* – IKC’s data protection enabled multi-catalog approach improves the ability to organize and distribute data across the organization
- *Control data risk and ensure data quality* – IKC’s data protection rules, SLA rules, and Next Gen Data Quality ensures the safety and quality of data for improved use in Analytics and BI
- *Automate manual processes and speed up time to value* – robust automation integrated across the product to enable faster governance of data so that you can use more of your data across your organization

### How complex is modernization?
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. **The purpose of the FREE Technology Expert Labs Assessment is to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan**. The <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGmpRf8dgCpP8fHC6TMmq9mXChG">Legacy Migration Sales Guide</a> has a summary of the migration limitations of the semi-automated tooling and the comparisons of functionality between IGC and IKC.  

Note: Customers will first need to upgrade to the latest IGC version, before modernizing to IKC. 

## IGC/IKC Modernization journey
This diagram shows the IKC Modernization journey at a high level. Each section is broken down in detail with links to assets below.

## Engage Client phase
**Led by:** Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller<br/>
**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor

Before entering this phase it is necessary to discuss the topic of IKC modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.

This phase covers the steps necessary to have the first conversation with the customer about IKC modernization (**Executive level meeting**). We've provided a sample *Compelling Reason to Act* which is generic and applicable to most IGC customers as well as a deck from Product Management that goes into more depth on the value of modernization from IBM InfoSphere® Information Governance Catalog (IGC) and/or IBM Information Analyzer (IA) and moving them to IBM Knowledge Catalog running on Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShiftn.

The **outcome** of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in a **Modernization Briefing** and workshop where IBM and the customer will work together to scope and plan the modernization project.

## Assessment and Strategy Phase
**Led by:** Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect/Solution Engineer<br/>

Technology Expert Labs (Solution Architect/Solution Engineer) will use a questionnaire and ISX export from IGC along with an assessment tool to analyze the customer's IGC environment and provide a findings report card complete with a migration analyisis and one or more service options to align with the customer's requirements.
