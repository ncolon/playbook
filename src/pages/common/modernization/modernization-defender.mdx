## Scope

**Defender** is a flexible suite of products sold as "pay as you go" entitlements which modernise data resilience - assuring a customer that their data is as it was written,
and can be recovered quickly and flexibly no matter if it is in a Hybrid Cloud environment, or a dedicated datacentres.
**Defender modernisation** is about moving customers to a system which allows them to enable requirements they previously hadn't considered, quickly and easily. 
When a customer has Defender entitlements, they can implement new features for primary and secondary storage as they are added to Defender or move their entitlement from
products which no longer fit their needs to different elements within their entitlement.

Any customer who has any of the packages installed should be considered within scope for this modernisation play.

**Product: ** IBM Storage Protect Suite (Protect, Protect Plus, CDM, Snapshot and all TDPs) <br/>

## Why should a customer modernize?

If a customer has any concerns that they **can't get their data back in a timely manner**
in the event of a Ransomware attack, accidental or deliberate deletion, failed hardawre, or physical disaster, they should consider Defender.

If a customer is operating on older versions of Protect, Protect for Virtual Environments for the VM data protection, or if they're using Protect Plus,
they should seek to modernise.

If a customer is using a data protection package as a de-facto Archive, they should seek to modernise. Moving from a system where backup and archive are treated as
synonomous to one where Operational Recovery and Archival data are properly separated for robust recovery is a key feature of Defender.

If a customer can't identify their minimum viable business or the safe recovery points that would allow them to recover quickly, they should consider Defender.

- 83% of organizations have experienced more than one data breach
- 60% of organizations had to raise their product or services prices due to a breach, impacting competitiveness
- 17% of Cyber Attacks are Ransomware
- 26% of Clients who paid the ransom still could not recover the data
- 23 days = average recovery time needed after a ransomware attack
- $5M = Est. average annual cost of a Cyber Attack in 2023

With insurers and re-insurers pulling out of the Cyber Insurance market or putting significant limitations on policies and payouts it is more critical than ever that 
a customer uses their primary and secondary storage systems to detect and prevent, rather than relying on insurance for what is increasingly a day-to-day business eventuality.

You can't simply "just pay the ransome" there are no gaurantees data will be returned or recoverable. There are many nation-state attacks where paying the ransom would violate
international financial sanctions.
