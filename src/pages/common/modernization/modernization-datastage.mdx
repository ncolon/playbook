## Scope
DataStage modernization is the process of taking customers from IBM Infosphere DataStage, IBM Infosphere QualityStage or IBM Information Server and moving them to DataStage “NextGen” running on Cloud Pak for Data on OpenShift. To run DataStage NextGen, the customer needs to have licenses to either DataStage Cartridge or Information Server Cartridge. You can learn more about DataStage on our <Link to='/common/data-ai/csm-data-ai-data-stage-data'>playbook page</Link>

### Why should a customer modernize?
DataStage NextGen on Cloud Pak for Data provides customers with the next generation of DataStage and includes the following benefits:
- Redesigned GUI using modern, web-based canvases that do not require re-training of client developers.
- Additional data integrations to help virtualize, replicate, stream, and prepare data before or after the ETL job is completed in DataStage.
- Micro-services-based architecture & containerized, optimized for hybrid cloud workloads
- Dynamic scalability & high resiliency
- Databand (licenses sold separately) can provide data observability to ensure data quality, security, and performance levels of the ETL jobs
Metrics based on research and client experiences:
- 30% throughput execution improvement over legacy DataStage
- 87% savings in development cost when using GUI compared to hand-coding ETL jobs
- 60% increased efficiency (minimal upgrade efforts)

For client-facing material, see the Compelling Reason to Act in the [Engage Client Phase](#engage-client-phase) section.

### How complex is modernization?
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. The purpose of the Technology Expert Labs Assessment is to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan. You can find a graphical view of the modernization and an example report from Technology Expert Labs starting on slide 44 of the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/5uxv3r7htt6vus6ljn1uypt3jxrz30zz">IBMs DataStage Modernization PoV Deck</a>

Read DataStage Product Management's views and thoughts on having a Modernization Discussion with your client: [DataStage NextGen Review](https://github.ibm.com/Stephanie-Valarezo1/ds-nextgen-review)


In summary, assets can be modernized from DataStage Standalone to DataStage NextGen on Cloud Pak for Data using one of the three paths (and only one path is manual):
- Automated (ISX Import Service) - Parallel Jobs, Parallel Shared Containers, Parameter Sets, Parallel Routines
- Semi-Automated Migration Tool (MettleCI) - Server Jobs
- Manual Rewrite - Server Routines

IBM has confidence that DataStage NextGen is ready for customers to modernize from IBM Infosphere DataStage, IBM Infosphere QualityStage or IBM Information Server and that a repeatable process exists with our DataStage modernization journey.<br/>

## Engage Client phase
**Led by:** Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller<br/>
**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor

Before entering this phase it is necessary to discuss the topic of DataStage modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.

This phase covers the steps necessary to have the first conversation with the customer about DataStage modernization (**Executive level meeting**). We've provided a sample *Compelling Reason to Act* which is generic and applicable to most DataStage customers as well as a deck from Product Management that goes into more depth on the value of modernization from legacy DataStage runtimes to the OpenShift- based *NextGen* version.

The **outcome** of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in a **Modernization Briefing** and workshop where IBM and the customer will work together to scope and plan the modernization project.

## Assessment and Strategy Phase
**Led by:** Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect/Solution Engineer<br/>

Required inputs by CSM (from Modernization Briefing/Discovery):
- Project objectives and requirements
- Completed DataStage questionnaire including DataStage project export(s) preferably from the Production Environment (instructions provided in the questionnaire).

Assessment is performed by Technology Expert Labs after the Modernization Briefing where the CSM has gathered the required information about the Customer's DataStage environment (questionnaire and export of environment). 

The purpose of the Assessment Phase is to take the questionnaire and export and determine the level of effort to modernize a customer. Technology Expert Labs (Solution Architect/Solution Engineer) will use an in-house automation tool to analyze the customer's DataStage assessment information and provide a findings report card complete with feature parity and deprecated module analysis and one or more service options to align with the customer's requirements.

You can find an example report from Technology Expert Labs starting on slide 45 of the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/5uxv3r7htt6vus6ljn1uypt3jxrz30zz">IBMs DataStage Modernization PoV Deck</a>.
