## Scope
WebSphere modernization is the process of moving applications from *traditional* WebSphere to (WebSphere) Liberty.  <br/><br/>
Traditional WebSphere is a monolithic application server that was designed for large applications that are deployed and updated infrequently. Modern, agile businesses need to develop, deploy, manage and scale smaller applications that are frequently updated, which is one of the reasons why IBM created Liberty. Liberty is part of <Link to="/common/automation/csm-automation-websphere-hybrid-edition/"><strong>WebSphere Hybrid Edition</strong></Link> and <Link to='/common/automation/csm-automation-cloud-pak-for-applications/'><strong>Cloud Pak for Applications</strong></Link>, key entitlements CSMs are responsible for. <br/><br/>
Modernizing from traditional WebSphere to Liberty can also include modernization of operational practices towards DevOps and modernization of the application code and architecture towards smaller, micro-services like applications. The level of investment required to modernize application code is high, so it is necessary to analyze and prioritize applications to receive the best return on investment.<br/><br/>
**IMPORTANT:** Customers can use <Link to="/common/automation/csm-automation-websphere-hybrid-edition/"><strong>WebSphere Hybrid Edition</strong></Link> OR <Link to='/common/automation/csm-automation-cloud-pak-for-applications/'><strong>Cloud Pak for Applications</strong></Link> for their modernization. Both include WebSphere entitlements that can be used for traditional WebSphere Network Deployment, traditional WebSphere "base" and WebSphere Liberty and allow deployment in non-containerized or containerized environments. WebSphere modernization **does not** "require" OpenShift, some applications may stay on WebSphere ND, some may run on non-containerized Liberty and some may run in containers. The primary objective is to remove technical debt and keep our customers on WebSphere in general.

## Why should a customer modernize?

### Modern business goals 
Technical Debt is consuming more and more of the IT budget each year. Gartner suggest that by 2025, technical debt will consume more than 40% of the current IT budget. Applications running on traditional WebSphere often have the following types of technical debt:
- difficult to upgrade runtimes due to time and effort required to apply and test upgrades in environments with large numbers of servers and applications
- difficult to enhance applications due to monolithic application packaging
- weak security posture due to lack of automatic/complex runtime patching and complexity of application build/test/deploy cycles
- inefficient manual/custom administration processes 
- inefficient use of compute resources due to complex runtime scalability and elasticity

The goal of WebSphere modernization is to align with the business objectives of the modern business: 
- improve sustainability and lower infrastructure costs by using "just enough runtime" for the application and increasing application density.
- improve security and lower administrative costs by adopting continuous delivery for applications and utilizing the "zero migration" capability of Liberty which elimiates the need for version to version and fixpack migration activities.
- increase developer and digitial productivity with a developer optimized set of tooling and Kubernetes optimized runtime. 

These objectives can be achieved by modernizing applications to run on WebSphere Liberty and adopting modern automation and CI/CD practices. 

For example, <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/proving-the-websphere-modernization-path-to-liberty-on-openshift-at-discover">Discover</a> wanted to modernize their WebSphere operational model to introduce dynamic scalability while reducing time and resources required to configure and maintain hundreds of applications deployed on-prem across multiple data centers. Using IBM Transformation Advisor, they were able to identify common code and streamline their modernization to Liberty on OpenShift, reducing the time to modernize each application from months to 3-10 days.

Another example is **Lloyds Banking Group**(should not be used outside IBM), where they have been using traditional WebSphere for a long time are now in the process of modernizing usinng CP4Apps.  Some of the value Lloyds is finding from CP4Apps is the following:
 - They came from IBM Cloud Private(ICP) so shared migration of licenses was helpful 
 - Runtimes: They are a big WAS shop & and they also have RH OpenShift used in there(one stop shop).
 - Support: Having a single support team to contact helps a lot when you are running IBM software on your OCP. L2 support being together in the same process helps given any issue can be tracked thru a single ticket, rather than 2 companies trading off against two portals.
 - One other advantage for Lloyds is Z, CP4Apps allows them licenses for Z platform & X86 which they are using.

The diagram below shows the main types of WebSphere modernization:
![was-modernization](../images/websphere-modernization-journey.png)

- **Modernize Runtime**: move the applicaton with the smallest amount of code change to Liberty but do not containerize. This gives the benefits of a modern runtime without the investment in moving to containers. However, this requires a traditional type of administration model and management. Some applications may end their modernization journey here. **This is the general focus of this modernization play. Making the jump to containers and microservices is a longer term objective**
- **Modernize Operations**: move the application and Liberty in to a container and get the benefits of a cloud-native operational model by adopting a DevOps methodology. An alternative to this step is to run traditional WebSphere in a container, which is a valid approach and and is used for applications that are too complex or costly to move to Liberty. Some applications may end their modernization journey here.
- **Modernize Architecture**: break the application in to smaller pieces and develop and manage them like other cloud-native applications. This is a significant investment and many customers may choose to rewrite their applications instead of breaking the older application up.

It is not a "one-size fits all" approach to modernization. Each application should be evaluated and have it's own modernization journey.

## How complex is a modernization?
The process to modernize Java applications is to use IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor to triage applications and identify candidates for low-touch modernization of the application server runtime (WebSphere Liberty). 
IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor can evaluate the effort to modernize existing Java applications, determine the best path for modernization and provide code and configuration accelerators to scale the modernization process across many applications. Several factors determine an application's path through the modernization phases and where it eventually finishes. Among those factors is the number of code changes that are required to move an application to a modern, containerized, cloud-ready application server and the business need for future investment in the application.

## Engage Client Phase
**Led by: Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller**
Before entering this phase it is necessary to have discussed the topic of WebSphere Modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan. 

This phase covers the steps necessary to have the first conversation with the customer about WebSphere modernization. We've provided a deck, which is generic and applicable to most WebSphere customers as well as a deck from Product Management that goes in to more depth on the value of modernization from WebSphere to Liberty.

The outcome of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in a **Modernization Briefing** and workshop where IBM and the customer will work together to scope and plan the modernization project. 

Process:
- Account planning should be performed to identify target personas and related metrics related to WebSphere modernization 
- CSM should create a Success/Growth Plan in Gainsight to track the progress of this potential project
- CSM should review the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCM2XQj4T66Mp8q2XGVcPPq9gRQd">WebSphere and Liberty positioning recording</a>
- CSM should review the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCBX24WbdXDjV8HRm7qGpcj2f9MG">Modernization Tooling recording</a>

- CSM can engage Venkata Gadepalli for guidance if necessary during this phase.


## Modernization Briefing Phase
**Led by: Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller**
This one day information briefing combines a presentation from IBM that covers the modernization options for traditional WebSphere in depth with a chance for the developers and administrators to get hands-on with Liberty and the modernization tooling as part of a Proof of Technology. 

This phase will typically be an in-person meeting with the following participants:
- IBM CSM, Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect, Account Team, ATL 
- Customer architect, developer, operations team, system designers and managers who are looking to learn more about WebSphere modernization.

At the end of the modernization briefing, Transformation Advisor should be used to analyze the existing WebSphere environment and applications which provides the input required to assess and plan the next steps.  

In some situations you may need to engage Client Engineering to complete a Proof of Experience to convince the technical team at the customer of the viability WebSphere modernization. In this case, we have provided detailed instructions in the Optional Client Engineering PoX Phase section below.

The outcome of this phase is that the technical team at the customer understands the capabilities and benefits of Modernizing their WebSphere workloads and Transformation Advisor has been used to collect data about the current environment. 

Process:

- CSM engages their Technology Expert Labs Seller (if you don't know your Technology Expert Labs Seller they <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://clientresourcelocator.wdc1a.cirrus.ibm.com/">can be found here</a>)
- Technology Expert Labs Seller creates an ISC record and engages the Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect (if necessary)
- CSM should present the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC7X2JC4mm2P382MbggWqXDdp2bP">Modernization Overview</a> Deck to start the briefing and level set on IBMs approach
- CSM should conduct the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/liberty-workshop/">WebSphere Liberty PoT</a>
- CSM and customer team should execute Transformation Advisor against a WebSphere ND environment, replicating the steps from the PoT lab exercise.
