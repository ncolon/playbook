Over the last couple of years, CSMs have been actively working to get our customers in a position to modernize - also referred to as migrating - to the Maximo Application Suite.  This has involved countless hours working to get customers up to at least 7.6.1.2, teaching the value of the application, and providing that reason to migrate.

</Row>
<Row>

## Why should my customer modernize to MAS?

</Row>

<Row>

- Improved usability with a unified lookand feel
- Single entitlement  across the suite
- Ease of implementation with OpenShift containers
- Provides industry-leading capabilities and functionalities
- Support for Maximo EAM is ending in 2025.

<Row>


IBM Technology Expert Labs - Software is a great partner to help your clients successfully plan and migrate to MAS.  Expert Labs experts will help your client overcome their reservations about moving to a Red Hat OpenShift platform, by providing best practices for planning, implementing and Day 2 Operations so clients get the full benefit of MAS that is easier to manage with OpenShift.  Expert Labs has two offerings in this space - the "Maximo Application Suite (MAS) Modernization Plan and Design" and
the "Maximo EAM to MAS Manage Migration Quick Win Offering," and can be engaged through the process below.

<br/>

To learn more about the offerings, you can watch the Replay of the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/playback/10337975">MAS Modernization Product Launch Sales Enablement</a>.  In this session, the speakers shared how MAS will modernize and revolutionize your clients’ business. They’ll talk about how to have winning conversations around MAS, and why Technology Expert Labs is the insurance policy for MAS.

#### Notes for CSMs

</Row>

<Row>

- This scenario assumes the Customer has upgraded their licenses to AppPoints, but has not upgraded their technical environment to MAS.  The activity to the left of the line have been completed.
- MAS Modernization Planning occurs between the Technology Expert Labs Seller and the CSM, and will be driven by the material in the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCGMFBj42P7DTG7R2H33b9pHfhBV9">Technology Expert Labs MAS Modernization Showcase</a>
- The contents of the "Technology Expert Labs - MAS Modernization Questionnaire" has been added to the Maximo Maturity Assessment (MMA) Customer Profile module.  If you have completed the Customer Profile with the Customer after version 1.1.0, you should have the information required.  If not, you do not have to complete the entire MMA, just gather the information required on the questionnaire.

### Plan

</Row>
<Row>

One of the first activities you will want to start with your client is planning. If they already have a plan,
use that as your starting point. But if not, they will probably ask for a template, because we’ve done this
before. The template below is our starting point. It is meant to include all the possible activities. It is
not expected that any client will need to do all of these. And it is likely that a client will have some
unique activities (approval, etc.) they want to add.

<br/>

The template has been used, and we have a few examples. All the durations are specific to the client,
depend on their skills, access to support staff, and amount of overhead in their processes. The examples
below are just that, examples you can look at to see how others have done it. Please make sure that if
you reuse an example, you first clean all the client references.

There are multiple people on those channels that can answer questions or point you in a direction to get the answer.<br/>

The best and fastest way to connect into the Support team is through the Support Escalation process.  This includes when SRE is involved.  Leverage the Maximo Support Escalation channel (ensuring you have followed the process steps prior!) and call for a Managed Escalation when it is approprite.  Err on the side of Support saying we don't need the Managed Escalation.
