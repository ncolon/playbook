## ![Resources page](../images/contribute.svg) Modernization Journeys Overview

In conjunction with Product Management and Technology Expert Labs, the Customer Success team has created "packaged journeys" that detail the steps that are required to go from opportunity identification to assessment and end with an Expert Labs services project for delivery at scale.

You'll find assets such as:

- curated, focused "compelling reason to act" pages that can be used with customers
- comparisons of existing point-products and the version that runs on OpenShift
- modernization workshop materials
- assessment questionnaires and processes
- Technology Expert Labs offerings and approaches

The diagram below shows the foundation of the modernization journeys and outlines how CSM, Account Teams, Client Engineering and Technology Expert Labs work together to idenitify opportunities, gain sponsorship, conduct a briefing/workshop and perform an assessment of effort. The result of the process is an Technology Expert Labs proposal to assist the customer through the modernization.

    Why modernize?
  </a> is a general modernization deck that can be used in C-level discussions to
  outline the benefits of modernization for organizations
- The building a <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/5i0je2aujpitcungutwnmc8it94h9jlo">_Modernization POV_</a> guidance is useful when starting the modernization conversation with your customer
- A [Why modernize on OpenShift](/common/redhat/objections) video and deck are available for use when customers need convincing to adopt OpenShift

### Automation Modernization Journeys

Application modernization is a necessary part of cloud-centric business transformation. Business pressures demand faster time to market. IT economics require greater workload mobility to allow migrations to the cloud, improving operational efficiency and cost reductions.

The success of a digital transformation depends on the ability of developers to build applications with innovative capabilities and deliver them quickly and to accelerate developer productivity and the adoption of new cloud-native technologies. Containers, Kubernetes, and microservices deliver speed and simplicity and are being adopted rapidly. But, your current estate determines your modernization strategy. Rewriting your entire application estate isn't feasible, so modernization is inevitable.

### Data & AI Modernization Journeys

Data modernization is the process of updating and transforming legacy or outdated data infrastructure and technologies to a more efficient and flexible modern data architecture that can support new business requirements and enable better decision-making. The modernization process typically involves migrating data from older software to newer ones, adopting cloud-based data storage and processing, incorporating big data technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, and implementing data governance and security policies to ensure data privacy and compliance with regulatory requirements.

The goal of data modernization is to make data more accessible, secure, and scalable, and to leverage it to drive innovation, gain insights, and improve business outcomes.
