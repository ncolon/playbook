## Scope
IBM MQ is the proven messaging for hybrid and multi-cloud that’s high performance and security-rich. Modernization is not about just moving to containers. Clients are not fully taking advantage of latest features and functions or full value potential of MQ. MQ Modernization is to assist the client along the path of getting the best use of their investment and to help clients lagging in their adoption of modern architecture

## Why should a customer modernize?

IBM MQ has enabled secure, reliable and scalable communication across and between enterprises for over 25 years. As organizations embrace this transformation, their messaging landscape needs to transform to assure it continues to meet the needs of the business. Common challenges include:
- Many existing customers are re-evaluating their connectivity solutions due to public cloud adoption.
- Existing deployments no longer fit for purpose as design decades ago when the landscape and requirements differed. 
- Achieve faster and more flexible solutions by using OpenShift Container Platform 
- Drive to lower the total cost of ownership, by automating the day-to-day operations. 

These, and other, IT and business needs are creating increased and changing demand for messaging and most IT departments need to plan for these challenges.

To see an example of what a modernization project looks like, look at the following examples:
- Customer Use Case:<a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/9k0evrvb6tqwoq9x9ip82r9dnmpthqla">Marks & Spencer</a>
- Customer Success Story:<a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.biz/modusbox-success">ModusBox</a>

## How complex is a modernization?
Most clients running MQ in a traditional manner as a point product will have resistance to change to a new form factor.  Most enterprises have been running mission critical MQ workloads for a long time and are quite happy with the way things are running. You will face this challenge not just with MQ but any capability in the Integration portfolio. Hence the discussions should be moved away from a Middleware Vs. Platform discussion. 

Architecture modernization is a necessary part of cloud-centric business transformation to better position the client's business to meet current and future demands. These are the typical client trends & outcomes we see and many clients will have at least one of these as an objective.

- Developer Agility
  - Self Service
  - Non-functional based t-shirt sizes
  - Instant provisioning
  - DevOps Integration
  - Isolated environments

- Adopt Multi-Cloud
  - Automate & configure  deployments across clouds
  - Embracing Containers - changing runtime platforms

- Operational Agility
  - Evergreening – assure supported and compliant environment
  - Consolidate to a hub, to simplify operations.
  - Self service to allow interaction with MQ team only by exception

- Organic Growth
  - Improved high availability of solution
  - Improved security
  - Improved scalability of messaging and/or application
  - Improved access to or increased value of data



## Other points to note in MQ modernization
- MQ is one part of the larger <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/evolution-to-agile-integration/">agile integration architecture (AIA)</a>, and for some customers the larger picture may be the best starting point
- Consider the current distribution of non-production and production workloads. If the customer is using more than 25% of their MQ entitlements for non-production workloads then the trade-up will convert these to CP4I unfavorably for IBM. Work closely with the account team and brand technical seller to understand this before beginning the **Engage Client** phase

## Engage Client Phase
**Led by: Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller**
Before entering this phase it is necessary to have discussed the topic of MQ Modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan. 

This phase covers the steps necessary to have the first conversation with the customer about MQ modernization. We've provided a deck, which is generic and applicable to most MQ customers as well as a deck from Product Management that goes in to more depth on the value of modernization from legacy MQ runtimes to the OpenShift based version.

The outcome of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in a **Modernization Briefing** and workshop where IBM and the customer will work together to scope and plan the modernization project. 

Process:
- Account planning should be performed to identify target personas and related metrics related to MQ modernization 
- CSM should create a Success/Growth Plan in Gainsight to track the progress of this potential project
- CSM should review the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/wknahjl7ybu1j96pttikrmjpmprkrhsi">Modernization Conversation one-pager</a>
- CSM should use the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/m2pp95zovnno83faox1bzlbjwc3p3liq">Executive MQ modernization overview deck</a> to discuss the compelling reason to act. 
- A <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/5dlaxmjl90s24kuvpi9wrwikg9d5n24a">recording</a> of how CSMs can present this deck to customers has been provided by Callum Jackson.

## Modernization Briefing Phase
**Led by: Customer Success and/or Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect**
This one day informal and customized workshop will help clients consider what is needed to provide an industry leading messaging capability suitable to address their business challenges and pain points. The aim of this workshop is to propose potential high level plans and roadmaps using interactive whiteboard sessions with IBM consultants and specialists with experience in integration.

This phase will typically be an in-person meeting with the following participants:
- IBM CSM, Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect, Account Team, ATL 
- Customer architect, developer, operations team, system designers and managers who are looking for solutions to
better satisfy their messaging requirements.

The modernization briefing is used to articulate the capabilities and benefits of MQ Modernization and to complete the questionnaire required by Technology Expert Labs to be able to complete an assessment. We have provided a set of assets that should be used in the briefing below. They include an agenda, the MQ Modernization PoV deck and the assessment questionnaire. In addition, we’ve provided a set of links to Demos and Lab exercises that you may choose to show to the customer in the briefing.

You may engage the Technology Expert Labs Solution Architect for assistance with the questionnaire.

In some situations you may need to engage Client Engineering to complete a Proof of Experience to convince the technical team at the customer of the viability of the modernization to MQ on OCP. In this case, we have provided detailed instructions in the Optional Client Engineering PoX Phase section below.

The outcome of this phase is that the technical team at the customer understands the capabilities and benefits of Modernizing their MQ workloads and the assessment questionnaire has been completed.
