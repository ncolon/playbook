## Scope

IBM and Red Hat are partnering to help customers modernize and move their IBM products onto a unified Red Hat platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. Flight Path is Red Hat’s strategy to help clients understand the optimal starting points, get the foundations right, and transition to being hybrid cloud champions. IBM MQ is the proven messaging for hybrid and multi-cloud that’s high performance and security-rich. Modernization is not just about moving to containers or deploying MQ on OpenShift. Clients are not fully taking advantage of containers and surrounding technologies such as automation or the latest features and functions or full value potential of MQ. The MQ Flight Path Modernization will assist the client along the path of getting the best use of their investment and to help clients lagging in their adoption of modern architecture. The Modernization is designed to guide our clients through our proven intentional progress, which encompasses repeatable blueprints that are comprised of upstream open source engineering efforts from Red Hat and community partners such as IBM.

## Why should a customer modernize?

Application modernization is a process that improves software delivery performance for a business by updating rather than replacing older legacy software systems. For many organizations, this involves replatforming existing legacy workloads onto a modern cloud platform based on Kubernetes. It’s also common to adopt new ways of working, like DevOps, site reliability engineering (SRE) and CI/CD, as part of application modernization. IBM MQ has enabled secure, reliable and scalable communication across and between enterprises for over 25 years. As organizations embrace this transformation, their messaging landscape needs to transform to assure it continues to meet the needs of the business. Common challenges include:

- Many existing customers are re-evaluating their connectivity and platform solutions due to public cloud adoption.
- Existing deployments no longer fit for purpose as design decades ago when the landscape and requirements differed.
- Achieve faster and more flexible solutions by using OpenShift Container Platform
- Drive to lower the total cost of ownership, by automating the day-to-day operations.

These, and other, IT and business needs are creating increased and changing demand for messaging and most IT departments need to plan for these challenges.

To see an example of what a modernization project looks like, look at the following examples:

- Customer Use Case: <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/9k0evrvb6tqwoq9x9ip82r9dnmpthqla">Marks & Spencer</a>

## How complex is a modernization?

Most clients running MQ in a traditional manner as a point product will have resistance to change to a new form factor. Most enterprises have been running mission critical MQ workloads for a long time and are quite happy with the way things are running. You will face this challenge not just with MQ but any capability in the Integration portfolio. Hence the discussions should be moved away from a Middleware Vs. Platform discussion.

Architecture modernization is a necessary part of cloud-centric business transformation to better position the client’s business to meet current and future demands. These are the typical client trends & outcomes we see and many clients will have at least one of these as an objective. Flight Path supports this effort through an iterative approach to break down the key factors for success that ecompasses both technical and business arenas.

- Developer Agility

  - Self Service
  - Non-functional based t-shirt sizes
  - Instant provisioning
  - DevOps Integration
  - Isolated environments

- Adopt Multi-Cloud

  - Automate & configure deployments across clouds
  - Embracing Containers - changing runtime platforms

- Operational Agility

  - Evergreening – assure supported and compliant environment
  - Consolidate to a hub, to simplify operations.
  - Self service to allow interaction with MQ team only by exception

- Organic Growth
  - Improved high availability of solution
  - Improved security
  - Improved scalability of messaging and/or application
  - Improved access to or increased value of data

## Other points to note in MQ Flight Path Modernization

- Flight Path’s vision is to inspire modernization journeys through intentional progressions to move customers forward and deliver frictionless experiences
- Build our plan around an agreed maturity state that will help drive understanding of both the progress and results
- MQ is one part of the larger <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/evolution-to-agile-integration/">agile integration architecture (AIA)</a>, and for some customers the larger picture may be the best starting point
- Consider the current distribution of non-production and production workloads. If the customer is using more than 25% of their MQ entitlements for non-production workloads then the trade-up will convert these to CP4I unfavorably for IBM. Work closely with the account team and brand technical seller to understand this before beginning the **Engage Client** phase

## Engage Client Phase

**Led by: Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller**

Before entering this phase it is necessary to have discussed the topic of MQ Modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.

This phase covers the steps necessary to have the first conversation with the customer about MQ modernization. We’ve provided a deck, which is generic and applicable to most MQ customers as well as a deck from Product Management that goes in to more depth on the value of modernization from legacy MQ runtimes to the OpenShift based version.

The outcome of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in a Modernization Briefing and workshop where IBM and the customer will work together to scope and plan the modernization project.

Process:

- Account planning should be performed to identify target personas and related metrics related to MQ modernization
- CSM should create a Success/Growth Plan in Gainsight to track the progress of this potential project
- CSM should review the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/opzxozn7zt8xkd01dp1rjzupjb0ee8nr">Modernization Conversation one-pager</a>
- CSM should use the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/hsfwzexr075a4eycxqkwm5opf5k4812x">Executive MQ modernization overview deck</a> to discuss the compelling reason to act.
