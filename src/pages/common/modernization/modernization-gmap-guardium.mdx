## Scope


The Guardium Migration Acceleration Program (GMAP) play is for clients with Guardium Insights entitlements to adopt the OpenShift platform (modernize) within 45 days with minimal customer involvement and access to funding to minimize migration costs.


## Use cases

The following use cases are covered by this play. A customer:

* Has Guardium Insights entitlement but has no OpenShift expertise and needs a managed OpenShift platform.
* Prefers working with a Hyperscaler (e.g., AWS or Azure) and wants to expand that relationship by deploying Guardium Insights on a Hyperscaler’s cloud.
* Needs to comply with the corporate strategy to move a workload to a Hyperscaler with minimal effort, cost, and operational impact.
* Is under pressure to reduce the total cost of ownership for Guardium Data Protection.


## The Guardium Migration Acceleration Program (GMAP) – overview, objective, and scope
GMAP is a solution to fast-track data security and compliance modernization for current Guardium Data Protection customers with ELAs and Guardium Insights available for deployment from their catalogs. GMAP uses available Hyperscaler funding and credits to minimize and potentially fully absorb IBM Technology Expert Labs fees, Business Partner consulting service fees, or hyperscaler infrastructure fees a customer might incur during a migration. IBM’s templated approach enables customers to modernize their legacy Guardium Data Protection environment typically within 45 days, with minimal customer involvement. 

The primary objective of GMAP is to establish the foundation necessary for a legacy Guardium Data Protection customer to benefit from the software advances IBM has released for enterprise data security and compliance operations. The GMAP foundation begins by simplifying the customer’s architecture (see the figure below) to eliminate Aggregators and consolidate Collectors. The remaining Collectors stream events directly to Guardium Insights running on a Hyperscaler using Red Hat OpenShift. Guardium Insights provides centralized reporting for the entire hybrid-cloud environment, as well as consolidation of comprehensive management capabilities, such as Access Management, patching, and a metadata repository.

### Customer benefits of GMAP
GMAP provides customers with strategic, operational, and financial benefits.

*Supports enterprise “Cloud-First” initiatives* <br/>
GMAP enables Customer Data Protection/Compliance teams to better support their enterprise clients as they migrate existing applications to the Cloud and build new Cloud-native applications. GMAP supports Data Protection/Compliance toolset migration to the Cloud, enabling Security team compliance with enterprise “Cloud-First” mandates.

*Simplifies and modernizes data security and compliance architecture*
GMAP eliminates Guardium Data Protection Aggregators, consolidates Collectors, and enables direct Collector streaming to a single instance of Guardium Insights running on a Hyperscalers cloud and Red Hat OpenShift. Soon, agentless Guardium Data Protection capabilities will minimize the need for Collectors as well.

*Streamlines IT and business processes* <br/>
GMAP provides auditors and compliance officers with a consolidated source for compliance information, helping streamline audit, compliance, and reporting processes. GMAP enables an enterprise to begin using contextual analytics that significantly reduces event volume sent to the SIEM. As a result, more actionable event data is delivered to Security Operations Center personnel helping decrease their workload. Finally, the simplified architecture GMAP delivers reduces the IT workload required to operate and maintain security appliances and related software.

*Reduces Guardium Data protection total cost of ownership* <br/>
GMAP significantly improves key elements of an enterprise’s Data Security and Compliance cost structure, including IT infrastructure, software, IT labor, and business operations labor. GMAP provides the CSM with the tools, support, and insight necessary to help customers quantify, understand, and communicate GMAP’s business value.

*Eliminates customer deployment barriers* <br />
GMAP uses the combined resources of IBM, TEL, IBM Business Partners and Hyperscaler to remove barriers (Figure 3) that may be preventing customers from realizing the full value of Guardium Data Protection.

### Benefits of GMAP for the CSM
GMAP helps the CSM achieve their business objectives by driving customer value. By using GMAP, CSMs:

* Increase the customer’s ELA return on investment by enabling the use of Guardium Insights from their current catalog.
* Improve the breadth and depth of their customer relationships by collaborating with the Hyperscalers and IBM Business Partners and connecting to their customer networks.
* Position additional customer value to drive future growth opportunities.
* Help customers identify Red Hat OpenShift options and realize the value of OpenShift as an integral component of Guardium Insights operating on a Hyperscaler’s cloud.

### GMAP Engagement Model and team
The following diagrams summarize the GMAP Engagement Model and Engagement Team (see figures below). Details for each Phase of the Engagement Model and Team are provided below, including process steps, roles, outcomes, and links to assets.

![GMAP Engagement Model](../images/guardium-gmap-engagement1.png)
<Caption>Overview of GMAP milestones and deliverables</Caption>

The GMAP Engagement Team can include both IBM and external team members, based on the needs of the customer. The CSM is the engagement leader and customer interface during the Initiate and Assess/Mobilize Phases. If a CSM is not assigned to an account, the Security Software Sales Specialist will take on the CSM’s role. Customer interaction for the technical team begins to increase during the Assess/Mobilize Phase, with full technical leadership during the Phase Migrate/Modernize Phase.

![GMAP Engagement Team](../images/guardium-gmap-team1.png)
<Caption>GMAP engagement team</Caption>


CSMs receive dedicated support during the first two Phases of the engagement from the Americas GMAP Leader, who helps organize the Engagement team, tailor the GMAP Proposal, and address details related to Hyperscaler funding and Hyperscaler Account Team involvement. Finally, a CSM fine-tunes the technical team’s composition based on their knowledge of the customer, as well as input from the customer, IBM Account team, and GMAP Leader. Either Technology Expert Labs, a Business Partner such as Converge, or a combination of the two will provide Guardium expertise for both the planning and execution of GMAP.

## GMAP Phases

### Phase 1: Initiate Phase

![GMAP Phase 1 - Initiate](../images/guardium-gmap-p1initiate1.png)

<Caption>GMAP Initiate Phase and Customer Success</Caption>

**Led by** <br />
Customer Success

**Overview** <br /> 
Before beginning this Phase, it is necessary to meet with the IBM Account Team and Account Technical Leader to confirm the alignment of GMAP with the client’s strategy and IBM’s overall account plan. 

The initiate phase prepares the CSM to discuss and position GMAP with the customer.  The CSM begins by reviewing the generic GMAP presentation that is tailored to the customer’s specific situation and requirements.  A presentation from Product Management is also available addressing details on the overall value of Guardium Insights.

The outcome of this phase is the creation of a tailored GMAP presentation and confirmation of a customer sponsor supporting a GMAP Workshop. The Workshop allows IBM and the customer to work together to confirm the scope and plan for the modernization project.
