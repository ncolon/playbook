## Scope

Modernizing Cognos to CP4D provides a broader analytics implementation and integration strategy for a client.  There will be additional investment that the client will make in skills associated with CP4D and Red Hat OpenShift.   

## Why should a customer modernize?

The value in modernizing Cognos on CP4D enables the client to take advantage of capabilities: New support for viewing and editing Data Virtualization sources and the ability to generate an interactive graphic node as part of the Modeler stream in Watson Studio Premium.

Some of the key aspects that clients can benefit from in moving Cognos to a modern architecture and data platform:

### Modernize to a cloud-native architecture at your own pace:

- Ensure Managed Reporting Production workload SLAs are met with confidence using modern container architecture
- Simplify lifecycle management for upgrades and patches
- Leverage existing investments in reports, data sources and distribution mechanisms
- Modernize at your own pace

### Access exclusive functionality available only via cartridges:

- Leverage market-leading advanced data preparation services for BI-ready datasets
- Enable the most secure and compliant strategy with data governance for managed reporting and data exploration
- Analyze data where it resides with data virtualization
- Easily integrate data science in one place with related offerings
- Instantly inherit predefined data source connections for more efficiency and consistency
- Getting started now with Cognos Analytics on Cloud Pak for Data

### Managed Reporting workloads

- The single biggest workload in an organization
- Pixel-perfect reporting, scheduling, bursting, mass delivery
- Data Analyst/Explorer workloads
- Preserves historical investment in studios and older Cognos data sources such as PowerCubes

### What you can do standalone today, in Cloud Pak for Data later

- Planning Analytics integration
- Configuration & Capacity Management
- Mixed license modes

Leverage all the key benefits of **watsonx.data** for Lakehouse data ingestion and analysis.


## Engage Client phase


**Led by:** Customer Success and/or Brand Technical Seller

**Audience:** Executive/Sponsor

Before entering this phase it is necessary to have discussed the Cognos modernization with the account team and Account Technical Leader to ensure that it is part of the overall account plan.

The **outcome** of this phase is that a sponsor is interested in investigating the additional value that the organization will gain from Cloud Pak for Data and Red Hat OpenShift capabilities and that the client sees the value in other aspects like **Integration, Governance, watsonx.data etc.**
