## Scope
IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) modernization is the process of taking customers running workloads on traditional point products and moving them to Business Automation Workflow (BAW) running as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation on OpenShift. 

Most clients running BPM in a traditional manner as a point product will have resistance to change to a new form factor. Most enterprises have been running mission-critical workloads for a long time and are quite happy with the way things are running. You will face this challenge not just with BPM but with any capability in the Business Automation portfolio. Hence the discussions should be moved away from a Middleware Vs. Platform discussion to more of a discussion around the current pain points of the customer.

In 2018, BPM and IBM Case Manager (ICM) combined to create BAW, a key capability of IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation. This single offering empowers companies to automate a variety of workflow patterns, from straight-through processing (STP), to ad-hoc, to advanced case management, and everything in between. It is important to emphasize that BAW is built on the same foundation as BPM and ICM so existing case and process solutions can remain as-is, with no need to re-write applications or migrate code from the latest versions.

You can learn more about BAW in <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCRFm2Cjhb3gHGcWJcjcFD7QD84P#/?anchorId=c79a7260-a948-4f57-8410-8cdd85a99a45">Seismic</a>.

- Enhanced decision making
  Use built-in visibility and AI to identify the best actions via intelligent task prioritization and decision recommendation to resolve cases quickly and improve collaboration between IT and business teams.
- Visualized insights for business owners
  Use Business Automation Insights to extract business and system data from your BAW workflows that can be leveraged for doing analytics and creating ML models 

For client-facing material, see the Compelling Reason to Act in the **Engage Client Phase** section goes into more depth on the advantages of moving to CP4BA.

**How complex is a modernization?**
Modernization ranges from fully automated to manual. The purpose of the Technology Expert Labs Assessment is to analyze the existing environment and create a customized modernization plan. You can find a graphical view of the modernization and an example path from Technology Expert Labs starting on slide 13 of the <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' href="https://ibm.box.com/s/w7fhf89f86ergf5wab1zf6ey0a51zxai">Workflow Modernization POV Deck</a>

In summary, assets can be modernized from BPM Standalone to BAW on Cloud Pak for Business Automation. IBM has confidence that BAW on Cloud Pak for Business Automation is ready for customers to modernize from BPM and that a repeatable process exists with our Workflow Modernization Journey.
