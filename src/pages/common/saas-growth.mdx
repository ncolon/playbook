## What is SaaS?

Software as a Services (SaaS) is application software hosted on the cloud and used over the internet by way of a web browser, mobile app or thin client. SaaS solutions include the application/software, management, and infrastructure in one cost-effective way.  A SaaS solution can be hosted by the client or a service provider like IBM, AWS, or Azure. With a non-SaaS solution, the client needs to address all aspects of the software, management and infrastructure separately.

## Benefits of SaaS

The benefits of SaaS might be best understood when compared to non-SaaS software. SaaS is cost-effective, has lower overhead, is more current, and provides fast adoption and time-to-benefit.

## Strategies to drive SaaS revenue

When building a plan to drive revenue growth, the first step is to understand the levers to impact the revenue.

SaaS products are licensed as consumption-based or ratable. To form your strategy, you will need to know how the product is licensed.

| License type | Definition | Products | When is revenue impacted? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Consumption or Metered | Pay-per-use revenue that is recognized monthly based on usage. | SaaS products that are consumption-based include all wastonx products. | - Direct, monthly impact on IBM’s revenue when the client usage increases. <br/> - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) <br/> - Impact revenue immediately by driving more usage. |
| Ratable | Revenue is recognized in a consistent way over the term of the contract. It is a fixed amount of usage that is billed based on the contract term i.e. monthly/quarterly. | SaaS products that are ratable include SaaS products that are not watsonx. | - Revenue increase happens at the time of renewal and expansion to the next tier of usage. |

### Strategies for building SaaS with your customers

Cost savings, feature access, and on-demand scalability are all critical to how a CSM can help customers realize the benefits of SaaS. Your customer may be already using SaaS. It is important to connect SaaS benefits with your customer's business objectives.

<Tab label='1. Research the client'>

First, research your client by looking at the entitlements. This includes: 
* New sales opportunities in ISC
* Standalone, SaaS licenses in Gainsight. See the <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-csm-dash/'>Gainsight dashboard.</Link>
* IBM Cloud subscription licenses, If you're not familiar with IBM Cloud Subscription entitlements start by looking at your entitlement list for IBM Cloud and dive deeper into usage and burn-down reporting in Gainsight. (link to learn more about IBM Cloud SaaS)

</Tab>

<Tab label='2. Review client industry'>

Second, review the latest about your client's business points and industry. See <Link to='/onboard/understand-client-it-landscape/'>Learn about your customer</Link> for ideas on researching your client.

</Tab>

<Tab label='3. Explore expansion opportunities'>

After you understand the client's pipeline and entitlements, explore opportunities for building your growth plans.

Recommendations include: 
* Review the <Link to='/onboard/strategic-account-planning'>Account planning</Link> in ISC.
* Explore <a href='https://ibm.biz/IBM_STARS'  target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>STAR</a> for assets of implementations that address similar challenges or obstacles your client might have.
* Hold a <Link to="/use-case-discovery/" target='_blank'>use case discovery session to find the right opportunity</Link> as part of the QBR.
* Define the <Link to='/onboard/business-outcomes-framework'>business value of the solution</Link> as a lunch and learn.

### Leveraging IBM Cloud catalog subscriptions to grow SaaS 

The IBM Cloud catalog includes many SaaS growth offerings including wastonx. Using the IBM cloud subscription, a client doesn’t need to worry about the management and infrastructure. The customer can provision and onboard the SaaS solution quickly.

CSMs can see the IBM Cloud subscriptions in Gainsight under the IBM Cloud relationship in Gainsight. This consumption subscription or metered revenue is recognized based on the usage a client has in the current month and will immediately improve revenue to IBM. To achieve SaaS growth for these clients, drive more usage and it will immediately drive revenue growth.

### Subscription burndown

A Watson Subscription is a purchase of Entitlement Credits that can be used to pay for services and resources used 
on the IBM Cloud Platform. When your client places an order for a Watson Subscription, they receive a subscription code. They need to create an IBM Cloud account and apply the subscription code to the account. This loads the purchased entitlement credits into 
the account.

Subscription codes are managed by authorized users on the IBM Cloud account. The customer designates users who can apply the codes and ‘order’ or use credits for new deployments. If the client fails to enter the code, the revenue is not recognized.

## SaaS target deployment metrics

Each SaaS product has specific target metrics to determine the CS deployment metric.  CSMs should create and manage their growth plans following our best <Link to='/onboard/gainsight-create-growth-plan/'>practices</Link>. After your growth plan reaches the deployed stage, usage will be reported until the client reaches the deployment milestones defined by the product. The initial deployment, expansion criteria for additional deployments, and churn are defined at the product level.
