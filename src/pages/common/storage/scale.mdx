## What are the pain points that IBM Storage Scale addresses?

**Storage Scale prospects may face the following challenges**
[See the Seller Enablement Deck for more information (slide 8)](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCdFBPR9pgVpJGhQ6MVPj6Fh8gWd)

- New generations of application, such as AI and analytics, bring new challenges of storage infrastructure. Distinctive qualities required include:
  - Ability to match performance requirements
  - Ability to scale anywhere from small to extremely large deployments
  - Ability to share data to different applications
  - Ability to minimize data movement, data copies
  - Ability to manage the data complexity
- Cyber resiliency requirements mandate securing the data storage layer

<br />
<strong>Additional challenges Storage Scale System solves for prospects</strong>

- Lack of expertise to build and deploy, for example hardware, networking and so on
- Time consuming to design, implement, optimize, and test the solution before deployment

### Risks in unproven architecture

[The Prospecting guide](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC4PhfXPhMPp3GMDpfjDbP8gmT73) has a bit on points and on value props. You can think about value props as something that solve a pain point, for example the following is a value prop:

- Cyber Secure Data Security Services
- Safeguarded Copy and built-in encryption with multi-site resiliency

You can turn that back around into a pain point: “I don’t have a good solution for security and resiliency for my unstructured data”

</InlineNotification>

![Managed Data Everywhere](./images/scale1.png)

Again, many businesses will have a mix of AI applications: Some focused on solving business process problems while other AI will be used to automate and/or address more technical oriented challenges in other parts of the business.

The best way to approach this is to first understand how the client is using AI today. Is it more of a “businessey” kinda AI or technical. If “businessesy” then it’ll likely be something that Ceph or watsonx.data can handle. If the AI they are doing requires GPUs, then you want to position Storage Scale. For now, keep it that simple.

## Why would a customer deploy IBM Storage Scale if they already have an existing solution?

A customer would deploy IBM Storage Scale to get the benefits of a [global data platform for unstructured data](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCmc7qB6W62mJG7CmMQXJVTqcj73)

### Data Virtualization and Global Data Platform

IT infrastructure choices for business applications continue expanding and evolving from traditional data centers to public cloud, and even out to the edge and remote offices. These choices expand further as businesses begin using GPU-accelerated infrastructure for data-intensive use cases such as AI and machine learning. These choices highlight a critical requirement for better methods for accessing data and collaborating securely while eliminating data redundancy and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>
As new applications and use cases roll out, data silos can appear across the various IT infrastructure options. These silos present challenges such as operational/cost inefficiencies and lack of data governance, highlighting a need for storage solutions that can unify unstructured data repositories across IT infrastructures.<br/><br/>
A [global data platform](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/storage/blogs/matthew-geiser1/2022/03/23/global-data-platform) for file and object data can address these challenges.<br/><br/>
See more at this [link](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/storage/blogs/matthew-geiser1/2022/03/23/global-data-platform) and in the summary below.<br/>

### A summary of customer challenges and how global data platform addresses them

Customers are struggling to provide unified and consistent data services across diverse infrastructure to support their business objectives. This data is often siloed, and customers often lack the fine-grained visibility needed to map data to business priorities. **The key concerns are**:

**Managing data across diverse infrastructure**.<br/>
Edge to core data center to public cloud.<br/>
Data silos - where is the data I need? What is the business value of a given set of data? Management complexities Etc ...<br/><br/>
**Providing a unified and consistent set of data services for all data across all infrastructure**<br/>
Unified and shared file and object access that enables applications to create and access data via their preferred / “native” protocol<br/><br/>
**The ability to get the right data to the right application at the right time, without making unnecessary copies of data.**<br/><br/>
**Visibility, control and automation into the file and object environment to drive efficiency**<br/><br/>
**Security services to identify and detect threats to protect an organizations file and object data** with the ability to quickly response and recover when security breaches occur. And…. How to do all this without deploying multiple “point products” further compounding the silo and management problems<br/><br/>
**Dealing with unprecedented data challenges to scale AI**<br/>
\- There’s more data, In more locations, In more formats, With less quality<br/>
\- How do I leverage analytics and AI at scale to gain competitive advantage?<br/><br/>

## How do I measure and report my IBM Storage Scale capacity-based deployment?

It is very simple to measure capacity being used for IBM Storage Scale. ILMT does not work since Scale is licensed by capacity and not by PVU.<br/><br/>
At the command line on a IBM Storage Scale cluster, you can issue the below command and it will return the usable capacity in bytes. This can then be converted to tebibytes or pebibytes using a converter tool available online.<br/><br/>
`mmlslicense --capacity –-formatted`<br/><br/>
Clients for use IBM Storage Scale GUI (look under the “About” tab) to find this information.
