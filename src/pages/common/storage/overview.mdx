## How do I drive Adoption

Most of the Diamond customers you are assigned to will have one of more of the cloud paks as part of their catalogue. Deployment of any of the cloud paks will require underlying Storage. It is critical that the storage and compute layers are considered by the customer as early on in their projects as possible.

See the IBM Storage Software pages to the navigation column to the left for specific information.
