## What is IBM Storage Ceph and what does it do?

**IBM Storage Ceph** is an IBM-supported distribution of the open-source Storage Ceph platform that provides massively scalable object, block, and file storage in a single system. It is part of the [IBM Storage](https://www.ibm.com/storage) portfolio of software-defined storage.

IBM Storage Ceph is designed to operationalize AI with enterprise resiliency and consolidate data with software simplicity and run on multiple hardware platforms to provide flexibility and lower costs.

Engineered to be self-healing and self-managing with no single point of failure and includes storage analytics for critical insights into growing amounts of data. IBM Storage Ceph can be used as an easy and efficient way to build a data lakehouse for IBM watsonx.data and for next-generation AI workloads.

IBM Ceph Storage is the only commercial software-defined storage system that delivers multi-protocol (file, block, object) storage at truly massive scalability on industry-standard servers. Fully based on open source technology, it decouples storage from compute, allowing independent scalability. Aiding real-world challenges, IBM has considerable knowledge and experience for how Ceph operates at very large scale, supporting hundreds of petabytes and tens of billions of objects.

### IBM Storage Ceph storage was created to address four key areas:

#### Scalability

IBM Storage Ceph was designed to overcome traditional storage systems and their limitations by providing a scalable storage solution that can handle the ever-increasing amounts of data generated by modern applications. It allows for the seamless addition of storage nodes, enabling organizations to scale their storage infrastructure easily.

#### Fault Tolerance

IBM Storage Ceph prioritizes fault tolerance and data reliability. It uses a distributed architecture that replicates data across multiple storage nodes, ensuring that data remains accessible even in the event of hardware failures or network disruptions. By eliminating single points of failure and implementing data redundancy techniques, IBM Storage Ceph provides high levels of availability and durability.

#### Open Source

IBM Storage Ceph is an open-source project, which means that its source code for the storage is freely available to the public. The open-source nature of the storage encourages community collaboration and fosters innovation. It allows developers and organizations to contribute to the project, improve its features, and customize it to their specific needs. The open-source model also promotes transparency and reduces vendor lock-in.

#### Software-Defined Storage

IBM Storage Ceph is a software-defined storage (SDS) solution, which means that it decouples storage management and control from the underlying hardware. This abstraction layer allows organizations to use commodity off-the-shelf hardware for storage, reducing costs and providing flexibility in hardware choices. It also enables the dynamic provisioning and management of storage resources, simplifying storage administration tasks.

[IBM Storage is a leader in distributed file and object storage](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/storage/blogs/david-wohlford1/2022/10/21/ibm-is-a-leader-in-2022-gartner-magic-quadrant?CommunityKey=1142f81e-95e4-4381-95d0-7977f20d53fa) and with the recent [announcement of IBM Storage Ceph](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/storage/blogs/david-wohlford1/2023/03/09/ceph-storage?CommunityKey=1142f81e-95e4-4381-95d0-7977f20d53fa) has solidified its position with a new open source software option that is enabling customers to drive more cost effective solutions for their object storage requirements.

## What are the pain points that IBM Storage Ceph addresses?

#### Explosive growth and data scalability limitations

Businesses of all kinds want to produce meaningful insights from their data, driving explosive growth in data analytics and the need for scalable object storage. Supporting large multi-petabyte data sets is complex. Existing tools like the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) aren’t extensible due to data locality issues and close coupling of storage and compute resources.

#### Supporting multiple analytics and AI/ML/DL teams

Sharing large datasets is difficult with traditional tools, as multiple teams compete for the same big data resources and analytics infrastructure. Getting a bigger cluster or giving each team their own cluster are often not compelling or realistic choices.

#### Analytics resource congestion

Limited analytics resources cause difficult decisions and prioritization. Competition for analytics cluster resources can cause congestion, yielding frustration, failed service level agreements (SLAs), missed insights, and lost opportunities.

| **We only need “basic” Ceph**                                          | Red Hat and IBM have considerable experience deploying Ceph at very large scale. We can help accelerate and simplify your Ceph deployments, increasing the success of your project, deterministic performance at scale, and cost efficiency                                                                                                                                        |
| **Ceph is complex, and difficult to manage**                           | Our reference architectures and Cephadm dramatically simplify the deployment and administration of Ceph clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **We use Hadoop, so we have to use HDFS**                              | You can use the Hadoop S3A connector instead of HDFS. IBM Storage Ceph is designed and proven to work with Hadoop with deterministic performance, letting you scale compute and storage independently.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Why should I use Ceph instead of Scale or COS?**                     | Each product has its advantages. You should use the products in tandem to maximize your value. For example, Scale provides a high performance parallel file system for HPC workloads. Ceph’s file system is general purpose, but by providing a scalable object store, it can house data more efficiently and connect with Scale to deliver the backend storage for HPC workloads. |

## There isn't a current use case, where do I start?

You can start with these qualifying questions:

- What are your major data sources that you must store and protect?
- What plans do you have for meeting the demands the growth of the amount of data to store and manage?
- Are the values from capabilities such as data compression, index and search important?
- Do you see value in a storage solution capable of supporting file, block, and object storage?
- What type of support do you require from vendor?
- Are you concerned that a start-up company might not exist anymore while you still have data their storage system?
- Scaling is probably something you want under your control. How important is it not to have vendor limitations?
- Does your workload require All-flash?
- How important is it to you to have a distributed scale-out environment based on industry standard hardware?

## Frequently asked questions

#### As an IBM CSM, do I get credit for deploying IBM Storage Ceph on IBM Cloud?

Yes, IBM Storage Ceph is one of the <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/customersuccess/the-practice/csm-covered-offerings' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Growth offerings that IBM CSMs cover</a>.

#### What is the value proposition for IBM Storage Ceph?

IBM Storage Ceph offers flexibility with unified block, file, and object storage, including industry-standard Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) object storage—on-premises or in the cloud. Teams can spin-up or spin-down clusters that share a common object data store, all on industry- standard infrastructure.

Sold by Red Hat as Red Hat Ceph Storage, it supports OpenStack applications2 and emerging container-based apps supported by Red Hat OpenShift3, letting organizations support existing virtualized apps and new container-based environments on the same data storage infrastructure.

## How do I measure and report my capacity-based deployment?

IBM Storage Ceph is licensed by Terabyte and reporting via ILMT does not work, as with all other capacity-based Storage products.
