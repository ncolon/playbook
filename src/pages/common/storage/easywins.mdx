## What is an easy win?

**IBM Storage Software Integration**: Put simply an easy win is where one IBM Storage Software product provides services to abother.
IBM's software defined storage is highly integrated from a product to product point of view,
IBM's software runs on extremely well on IBM hardware, but unlke other storage vendors' our software runs with no functional restrictions
on 3rd party hardware, hybrid cloud or a mix thereof.
<br/>

There's therefore a number of distinct types of "easy win" where one product can integrate with or enable sales of another:
<br />

**IBM Software Product Enhances another IBM Software Product** eg: IBM Storage Protect backing up Scale. <br/>
**IBM Software Product Enhances an IBM Hardware Product** eg: IBM Virtualize for Public Cloud extending an on-prem Flashsystem into cloud. <br/>
**IBM Software Product Enhanves a 3rd Party Software Product** eg: IBM Storage Discover indexing data stored on Dell Isilon or NetApp Filers. <br/>
**IBM Software Product Enhances a 3rd Party Hardware Product** eg: IBM Storage Archive controlling a 3rd party tape library. <br/>

<br/>

---

## But what it's not a product I'm remunerated on?

IBM has one of the largest software protfolios of any company and as such it is likely that you will come across different products on a pretty regular
basis that are included in a sale and not something on which you're remunerated. To this end, you'll need to consider how selling different products
enable the sale of others and how this can make IBM more sticky with the customer, or position products at a customer to enable IBM to move in to
make larger sales in the long run.

stores such as COS include online and nearline **immutable** and highly resilient storage systems, with multi-site erasure coding being able to maintain multiple disk,
node and site failures while still allowing access to data. COS is used as a target for **Defender Data Protect (Cohesity OEM)**, **Protect (Spectrum Protect/TSM)**
, **Protect for containers** and **Protect Plus**. In addition **Scale** can incorporate S3 data targets like COS for an inexpensive tiers in the global namespace. **Scale**
is able to move data to and from its own storage, to and from S3, tape, etc as requried.

**COS** can also be used to host snapshots from **Virtualize** enabling immutable snapshots of primary data storage where an additional **Virtualize (SVC/Cloud/Flashsystem)**
instance isn't cost effective.
<br/>

The **IBM Storage Ready-Node** can be used as a building block for Cloud Object Storage clusters, providing known scale and performance.

  <ListItem>Virtualize (SVC & Public Cloud)</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Multiple 3rd Party Hardware & Software Products</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

**Copy Data Manager** typically abbreviated to **CDM** enables **self-service pre-defined workflows** to be run on various **block storage products from multiple vendors**.
**CDM** integrates with many different software packages including databases (**Oracle**, **IBM DB2**, **Microsoft SQL Server**) enabling **application consistent snapshots**
to be taken for day to day operations, data analytics, pre-post upgrade, etc. Self-service requests which used to require multiple highly skilled DBAs and days of change 
approval can now be automated and data cen be moved into **test/dev** in a **psudonomised** form allowing developers and testers to work on production data which has had 
**all PII removed**. This data cen be de-psudonomised and moved back into production once work has completed.

Other use cases for **CDM** include **identification of orphaned storage snapshots**,
allowing for recovery. Snapshots for backups, which can be automated and mounted into **Protect (Spectrum Protect/TSM)**. 

**CDM** isn't just limited to databases, it supports Virtual Machine based workflows as well as many supported native applications.

It is not uncommon for **CDM** to be run entirely on 3rd party non-IBM products, which should provide adequate opportunities for sales of
products like **Virtualize SVC** or **Virtualize for Public Cloud** as well as for **Protect** snapshot integration.

  ### Defender Data Protect (Cohesity OEM)
** Available as part of, or licensed as:**

<orderedList>
  <ListItem>Defender</ListItem>
</orderedList>
<br/>

**Associated Offerings:**

<orderedList>
  <ListItem>Archive</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Ceph</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Cloud Object Storage (COS)</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Protect (Spectrum Proetct/TSM)</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Scale</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

IBM has started offering **Defender Data Protect** as de-facto replacement for the **Storage Protect Plus** product typically abbreviated to **SPP**. **Defender Data Protect**
is a scale-out data protection system which is high performance - instant restores at scale, etc. While **Defender Data Protect** excells at operational recovery, 
it is especially effective for longer retentions or archive functionality. To store data in a more dense format, potentially **tape** or **S3 object** consider **Protect (Spectrum PRotect/TSM)**
as a longer term storage tier.

If a customer is an existing **Scale** user and has no **Protect (Spectrum PRotect/TSM)**, **Scale** can be utilised as a method to move data into deeper/colder tiers, such as
**Ceph S3**, **COS**, **Archive (Tape)**.

<br/>
**NB: While Defender Data Protect** has a function called "archive" this is really an off-load and should not be considered as an archive product.

  <ListItem>3rd PArty - Dell Isilon</ListItem>
  <ListItem>POSIX Compliant Filesystems</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

**Discover** is a **metadata analytics** package, which has been enhanced to allow for **deep-indexing** and **access virtualisation**. Currently bundled with **Scale**
it should be considered for deployment with any of products listed above. In particular **COS** and **Scale**, for which it provides real-time analytics. Other products
use periodic scans to poll for updates. **Discover** is able to track files across multiple systems in an entire enterprise, so it is important that there are supported
backup packages like **Protect** and the most popular third party scale up and scale out file sysetms. 

Customers are able to use **Discover** to create simple "agents" based on the any of the monitored data points. For example: An agent could be written to alert a security 
team to tell them that an unusual amount of files have been accessed in a short period of time; an agent can search for duplicate files; an agent can trigger searches for PII
within different kinds of file types as they appear.

It is important that you can articulate what **Discover** does and why customers should want to use it, this has in the past been something that has been difficult for
many sellers to explain. Prepare before you need to do this!

**Details:**

**Fusion SDS** should be considered as not only a **Storage Foundation** for Fusion, but which through **Protect for Containers** a system to enable delivery of data protection for
**OpenShift** and **Kubernetes** systems. **Protect for Containers** sould be considred as the de-facto migration for **Protect Plus (SPP)** installations which 
protect container orchestration environments such as **K8S/RHOS**. If you have a customer on legacy **Portworx** environments for storage and data proetction, **Fusion SDS**
should replace these. This is especially the case for those **customers who were sold Portworx by IBM** and haven't been migrated to IBM software.

in operation at a client site. **Storage Insights** acts as a good stepping stone for **Storage Insights Pro**, which can be enabled via subscription
from the **Storage Insights** console.
<br/>

**Storage Insights Pro** provides a more in-depth feature rich service with features like AI based predictive analytics, etc. While CSMs are not remunerated
for sales of Insights Pro, it is a desirable product for customers to operate as it significantly enhances products for which they are.

  ### Protect (Spectrum Protect/TSM)
** Available as part of, or licensed as:**

<orderedList>
  <ListItem>Defender</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Protect Suite</ListItem>

  <ListItem>IBM Tape / LTO</ListItem>
  <ListItem>3rd Party Virtual Tape Library VTL ingest</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

**Protect** is a higly effective secondary storage package. It handles **Data Protection**, **Archive**, **Hierachical Storage Management (HSM)** and **S3 Ingest**.
**Protect** can scale up more than any other data protection package, addressing more than 4PB of online data (deduplication data) per single server. This makes
**Protect** ideally placed to protect **Scale** environments, even if a **Scale** environment contains more data than a single **Protect** server can address, **Protect**
can work in groups of servers to aggregate storage to protect an entire **Scale** environment. In addtiion, **Protect** can store its own data to **Scale**
with multiple **Protect** servers addressing a single **Scale** cluster, acting as part of the cluster itself, not just going through an entry point into the cluster.

**Protect** can write data to a multi-location **COS** cluster, this data cen then be replicated **Metadata Only**, meaning ultra-fast geo-dispursed recovery points.

**Protect** can store deduplicated data in S3, meaning making **COS** and **Ceph** ideal for longer term storage, such as archive or HSM.
This storage of data in cloud is highly write efficient, with local read/write "cloud cache" which won't drop objects, until they're no longer needed, 
meaning a real cash saving in the amount of HTTP GET operations required per recovery.

Block storage sytems like **Virtualize** (including **SVC**, **Flashsystem** and **Virtualize for Public Cloud**) can have snapshots orchestrated by **Protect** meaning
fast low-impact data proetction. These sysetms can also be used to storag data which is written by **Protect**, many customers are moving to **Flashsystem**
for data protection - protect can address 1PB of usable flashsystem in than 4U including server, delivering as much as 4PB of usable storage.

**Virtual Tape**/**VTL** can be utilised by **Protect** meaning that **a third party VTL can be used until fully depreciated**, then have its data **automatically ingested**
into a deduplciation storage pool.

**Tape** is a highly efficient storage medium for low power and highly secure storage of large amounts of data. **Protect** has best in class tape media handling.

  <ListItem>Protect (Spectrum Proetct/TSM)</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

**Protect for containers** delivering backup simplification is the #1 use case for **Fusion** both appliances and SDS. **Protect for containers** should be sold as
**RHOS** and **K8S** data protection services.
**Protect for Cotainers** should be considered the de-facto migration point for **Protect Plus/SPP**, if a customer is still using **Portworx Backup** which was
briefly sold by IBM, it should be considered as an immideate replacement candidate.

  <ListItem>Protect for Cloud</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Protect for Containers</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Scale</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

While **Protect Plus** should no longer be sold for new installations, it should be considered how customers intende to be migrated from **SPP** to the replacemnt packages.
Primary replacement will be **Defender Data Protect (Cohesity OEM)**, however it may be the case that elements will go to **Protect for Cloud** (M365, SaaS, etc)
and others to **Protect for Containers** (K8S, RHOS, Fusion).

**Scale**, **Ceph** and **COS** have historically been used to store data from **Protect Plus** it may be the case that these are expanded, or that when the services
are moved from **Protect Plus** to the replacemnt systems, these are freed up for other use cases: Bear this in mind when designing new products.

  <ListItem>IBM Storage Ready-Node (Single node Scale)</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Protect (Spectrum Proetct/TSM)</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

**Scale** has many integrated systems, primarily if a customer has a modern installation of **Scale**, it will have come with an entitlement for **Discover** included.
All customers should have **Discover** configured and operating, familiarity with **Discover** will drive adoption for other **Discover** use cases. If a customer
is not using **Protect (Spectrum Protect/TSM)** for data protection, it should be an easy sell, **Protect's** integratino with **Scale** is by far the best available
in the market. 

**Scale** can tier its data to different storage from flash based hot/fast, through S3 for cooler/less fast through cold/nearline in Tape. There should be use cases
for **Ceph S3**, **COS**, etc. **Archive** Enterprise Edition is designed for long term integrated storage providing the **tape** tier for **Scale**.

  ### Virtualize (SVC & Public Cloud)

** Available as part of, or licensed as:**

<orderedList>
  <ListItem>Defender</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Standalone</ListItem>

  <ListItem>IBM SAN Volume Controller (SVC)</ListItem>
  <ListItem>IBM Flashsystem (SVC)</ListItem>
  <ListItem>3rd Party Virtaiulized Storage</ListItem>
</orderedList>

<br/>

**Details:**

**Virtualize SVC** and **Virtualize for Public Cloud** are an important part of the IBM SDS portfolio. **Virtualize** is a key enabler for many of the modern software storage
systems, both primary and secondary. Much of the **Defender portfolio** is based on functionality delivered by Virtualize. This includes **real-time ransoware detection**;
**Sentinel** detection, protection and recovery orchestration for **Oracle**, **Epic Healthcare System**, **SAP HANA**.

Virtualize can be insatlled on-prem as the operating software of **IBM Flashsystem**. It can virtualize 3rd party vendors' storage sysetms and integrate them into services offered
by IBM products thus allowing all **Virtualize** services to be offered on 3rd party products - including **Safeguard Copy Immutable Snapshots**, a feature reserved by
many competitors for their top end products, which is offered across the board by IBM.

**Virtualize for Public Cloud* can offer all the services from on-premises in hyperscaller cloud, extending a tertiary replica point to cloud, or enabling far more smooth
movement of workloads around hybrid environments. Meaning that not only can hyperscaller be used as a DR point, but also that compute can be moved to wherever it is
most effective, not requireing large replications to and from cloud or format translations.
 
S3 targets such as **COS**, **Ceph**, **Protect (Spectrum Protect/TSM)**, can be used as targets for **flashcopy** snapshots to be written to, should there be no additional
array or requirements for them to be online.

If a customer already owns **Vitualize**, **SVC** or **Flashsystem** or **Virtualize for Public Cloud**, it should be considered that **Insights** is free, see **Insights**
page above. **Copy Data Manager** should be considred, as a method to enhance and simplify copy data "snapshot" services. 

If a customer has **Virtualize for Public Cloud**, it should be considred that Virtualize running on SVC on premises virtualizing 3rd party storage systems will deliver and
end-to-end storage product line running on a single toolchain. This is unparalleled in the industry.
