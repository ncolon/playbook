## What is IBM Storage Protect and what does it do?

**IBM Storage Protect** is a data protection platform that gives enterprises a single point of control and administration for backup and recovery, enabling backup and recovery for virtual, physical, and cloud environments of all sizes. And now, clients will be able to deploy IBM Storage Protect as a bring your own license (BYOL) solution directly from the IBM Cloud catalog very quickly to start protecting workloads in IBM Cloud, including running in Power VS, SAP HANA, and VSI environments.  
IBM Storage Protect is a data backup and recovery software. Storage Protect is part of the [software defined storage](https://www.ibm.com/software-defined-storage) products in the [IBM Storage](https://www.ibm.com/storage) portfolio. For backup and recovery of SaaS applications, see [Storage Protect for Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/products/storage-protect-for-cloud).
IBM Storage Protect provides comprehensive data resilience for physical file servers, virtual environments, and a wide range of applications. Organizations can scale up to manage billions of objects per backup server. Clients can reduce backup infrastructure costs with built-in data efficiency capabilities and the ability to migrate or copy data to tape, public cloud services, and on-premises object storage. IBM Storage Protect can also store IBM Storage Protect Plus data, allowing companies to take advantage of their existing investment for long-term data retention and disaster recovery.

## What are the pain points that IBM Storage Protect addresses?

- High backup Infrastructure costs
- Need to Backup and protect data in On premise, Cloud and/or Hybrid environments
- Need for long term data retention and /or disaster recovery

---

## The steps to deploy and who is responsible for what, when?

IBM Storage Protect follows the traditional model of: <br/><br/>
1: **Identifying a pain point, sponsor and use case**<br/>
The IBM team of Sales, Tech Sales and potentially CSM can use the list of pain points above along with a <a href='https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/client-engineering/engage' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Client Engineering</a> engagement to identify use cases and sponsors<br/><br/>

**Benefits to Clients:**<br/>
**Get multi-workload protection**: Lower operational cost by unifying and simplifying
data protection for physical file servers, virtual environments, and a wide-range
of applications.<br/>
**Achieve tremendous scalability**: Support massive data growth with a single server
to manage up to 4 petabytes of client data and ingest up to 100 terabytes of new
and changed client data per day.<br/>
**Drive storage efficiency**: Drive exceptional storage efficiency with incremental
forever backups, compression and deduplication.<br/>
**Build cyber resilience**: Protect your storage environment with two key authorization
for administrator commands, encryption, proactive security notifications, native
support for tape and immutable object storage.<br/>
**Get cost-effective data retention**: Meet your price and performance objectives
with cloud and on-premises storage options, including IBM Cloud Object Storage and
AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering support for inactive data.<br/>
**Leverage your investment**: Leverage your existing investment. IBM Storage Protect
Plus customers can leverage IBM Storage Protect for long-term data retention and
disaster recovery.<br/>

**Solutions**:<br/>
IBM Storage Protect user experience to simplify data services management<br/>
IBM Storage Protect with Ceph external storage<br/>

2: **Proving value (Proof of Experience, PoX)**<br/>
Tech Sales, Client Engineering, and CSM can work together to connect IBM Storage Protect to the customers’ systems and prove the capabilities resolve the pain points.

3: **Implementation project**<br/>
Technology Expert Labs can take ownership of an implementation project using their pre-packaged offerings. More infromation available [here](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCPVQPMJG7qc78qV6f7pPTCT7CFV).<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

### Common use cases for IBM Storage Protect are in the below areas:

#### Data replication

Replicate both deduplicated and encrypted data on an incremental and granular level from one server to another, or to two target servers to improve efficiency and security with different retention policies for onsite and offsite replication.

#### Comprehensive data protection

Enable advanced data protection for cloud, virtual and software-defined environments; core applications; and remote sites. Recover individual items, complex systems and entire data centers from primary and remote recovery sites. Integration with IBM Storage Protect Plus as a data copy target to leverage existing investment for long-term backup and recovery. Offers near-instant recovery, replication, reuse and self-service for virtual machines, databases and applications in hybrid cloud. See more at https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-storage-protect-plus

#### Cloud integration

Use cost-effective, security-rich container storage pools without additional hardware or gateway on IBM Cloud® , IBM Cloud Object Storage, Amazon S3, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and other validated S3 object storage services.

#### Data Lifecycle Automation

Make use of flexible data lifecycle automation rules to leverage existing backup data to meet long-term retention needs, without ingesting additional copies. Automatically move data from higher-cost storage to lower-cost storage as it ages.

#### Cyber Resilience

Get security notifications for potential ransomware attacks. Two key authorization for administrator commands; data encryption and native support for tape and immutable object storage enhance protection and ensure cyber resilience.

#### Solution bundles-Snapshot and Backup

Enhance flexibility with IBM Storage Protect Suite and IBM Storage Suite. Get an easy-to-manage license with snapshots and backup agents for virtual environments, containers, databases, email, and enterprise resource planning.

## How do I measure and report my capacity-based deployment?

ILMT does not work for capacity-based metric product such as Protect. In order to find the correct number of licenses deployed for declaration against the ELA catalog, the [Healthcheck](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Spectrum-Protect-Ecosystem/SPDataGathering/) process is used

The customer would need to run [a macro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Spectrum-Protect-Ecosystem/SPDataGathering/) on each of their Storage Protect servers and send us the output text. We then convert it into a Configuration Assessment report.
