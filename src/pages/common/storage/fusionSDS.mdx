## What is IBM Storage Fusion and what does it do?


**IBM Storage Fusion** is a simple to install and easily maintainable deployment of orchestrated data services on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Fusion can be added to an existing deployment or installed with a new cluster. It delivers block, file, and object storage in storage classes that are consistent across on-prem, public cloud, and multiple architecture deployments. Software-defined storage can be local in the cluster using Fusion Data Foundation (previously known as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation), or placed in an external Ceph cluster, or remote mounted from IBM Storage Scale. Object storage can be situated on-prem or in the cloud accessed using S3 protocols. Fusion has a backup and restore feature which is policy-driven and application-aware, enabling significant reductions in downtime for applications while a backup is performed, and the ability to restore to an alternate cluster. A data catalog feature enables Fusion to participate in AI pipelines and data governance scenarios. IBM Storage Fusion is certified for use and continuously tested with all IBM Cloud Paks.<br/><br/>

**IBM Storage Fusion** accelerates time to value of hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift. From the edge, to core, to cloud. Deployed on the customers' bare metal, On VMs, Ready nodes or Hyperconverged. IBM Storage Fusion delivers a simple, consistent, scalable and dynamic data management experience for containerized architectures. IBM Storage Fusion is also able to run legacy Virtual Machines alongside the containerized applications allowing for dramatic reductions in legacy hypervisor estates.  With IBM Storage Fusion clients can confidently modernize legacy applications and deploy next-generation workloads supported by enterprise-class data persistence, resilience, security, mobility, and cataloging. Clients also benefit from improved operational agility by increasing workforce productivity, accelerating time to value, ensuring application availability, and achieving as much as a 50% total cost of ownership return on the investment.

## Hyperconverged and Software: When to Differentiate; When to Integrate

When proposing IBM Storage Fusion to your customers, initially talk about the abilities of Fusion without differentiating between Software and Hyperconverged installations: Establish the use cases for Fusion and get customer buy-in of the broad concepts of Fusion before focusing on wheather the customer may find one, the other **or both** more appropriate. You will likely find that many customers will have a use case for Fusion in both HCI and Software integrated over multiple deployments platforms. This is especially the case for larger customers in hybrid on-prem and multicloud environments.


**Common reasons for chosing Fusion Hyperconverged include**<br/>
\- A Single system delivered pre-racked and cabled, which is operational in hours<br/>
\- Single point of contact for support of both hardware and software<br/>
\- Scale storage and compute predictably<br/>
\- Everything your customer needs is in one rack from compute, through storage to replication and resilience <br/>
\- The customer isn't locked in to IBM as a hardware vendor<br/>


**Common reasons for chosing Fusion Software include**<br/>
\- Multi-Cloud Deployments - Fusion eliminates the need to integrated different platforms from different hyperscalers <br/>
\- Operates effectively on-prem in smaller deployments such as SMEs or test/dev<br/>
\- Customers can use their preferred server platform <br/>
\- Deploys in small satellite or edge sites; deploys well at smaller customers<br/>
\- Deploys in virtualised environments alongside legacy VMs<br/>
\- Re-depoyment of legacy hypervisor server estate to Fusion as part of migration project<br/>


**Common reasons to deploy Fusion Hyperconverged and Software include**<br/>
\- Single integrated softawre platform for edge, cloud and on-prem means eliminates interoperation challanges<br/>
\- Highly dynamic positioning of compute in the right place at the right time for the right cost<br/>
\- Hybrid cloud/multi-cloud and on-prem deployments made easy<br/>
\- Re-depoyment of legacy hypervisor server estate to Fusion during migration<br/>
\- Re-Use of pre-existing compute platform(s) while migrating to Hyperconverged<br/>

## What do CSM driven deployments look like?

### Common use cases for Storage Fusion are in the below areas:

#### Platform Modernization with Red Hat OpenShift

Accelerate Day 1 deployment and Day 2 ongoing maintenance and operations with automation in full OpenShift integration. IBM Storage Fusion is an easy-to-use data services solution that is tightly integrated with Red Hat OpenShift. Its intuitive user interface and powerful APIs make it easy for anyone to get up and running quickly with on-demand provisioning.

#### Application Modernization

Cloud native application development, Cloud Pak implementation IBM Storage Fusion is the infrastructure platform for Red Hat OpenShift. IBM Storage Fusion provides the container native services that allow data to scale with the cloud native applications by taking a container-centric approach to backup and restore, HA/DR and security. IBM Storage Fusion’s robust APIs enable integration with DevOps, AI/ML and Data Analytics pipelines for automation. It is critical to design new data management approaches based on Fusion’s container-native data plane and resiliency services.

#### Databases, Analytics, Logging & Monitoring

Cloud-native applications are designed and built using cloud services that are scalable, resilient, and highly available. Logging, monitoring, data ingest analytics, SQL and NoSQL databases are popular with cloud-native applications because they can be easily scaled horizontally and vertically to meet the demands of the application. Fusion provides the data services that supports scaling and resiliency of modern data workloads

#### AI/ML, Analytics, Data Lakehouse

IBM Storage Fusion is the data services layer for lakehouse applications like watsonx that form the infrastructure for modern AI/ML data analytics pipelines by supporting GPUs and all structured/semi-structured/unstructured data types for data ingest, inferencing, model training, and deep learning.

#### Enhance IBM Cloud Paks

IBM Storage Fusion enhances IBM Cloud Paks with tightly integrated enterprise ready data services including backup, restore, and disaster recovery capabilities for Cloud Pak environments. Using automated policy-based recipes with application consistent backup and recovery, IBM Storage Fusion provides the best Recovery Time Objective & Recovery Point Objective (RTO/RPO) for cloud native applications.

#### **watsonx**

Clients that purchase watsonx are entitled to a starter kit of Fusion Data Foundation (100TB) and IBM Storage Ceph (500TB). Storage Fusion is positioned as a watsonx data accelerator and Storage Ceph is positioned as the object persistence store. Clients will want to run watsonx on Fusion Hyperconverged Infrastructure because of the function Scale, within Fusion, delivers as a global data cache and data accelerator. Storage sellers can help with the HCI Solution

#### Reduce Legacy Hypervisor Dependancy (VMware / Hyper-v)

Many clients are worried about their exposure to VMware license cost hikes. IBM Storage Fusion runs Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Virtual Machines alongside containerized applications, providing for migration away from expensive legacy hypervisors. further benefits are gained from the additional functionality provided by Fusion, such as backup and recovery. This provides for dramatic reduction in exposure to VMware licensing hikes, with a much reduced legacy hypervisor install base.

## Why would a customer deploy IBM Storage Fusion if they already have an existing solution?

### Top “Why to Buy” IBM Storage Fusion

#### Accelerate the cloud native journey

- Adopt a hybrid cloud approach to reduce TCO<br/>
- Leverage industry-leading technology for containers, applications, and data<br/>
- Rapidly deploy on-premises and in public cloud<br/>
- Simplify deployment and operation with consistent APIs and management<br/>

#### Leverage a proven enterprise-class architecture

- Scale applications from test to production with confidence<br/>
- Employ a rich set of application data services<br/>
- Data protection that is non- disruptive to the application<br/>
- Disaster Recovery to keep application up

The core value of Storage Fusion is derived from the “Fusion 5” -- five foundational application data services that deliver a consistent experience across public cloud and on-premises bare metal or virtualized platforms.

#### Data Persistence

Fusion delivers productivity and high performance to Platform Operations and developers through automation of data storage provisioning and access. Without Fusion, developers submit tickets to request application access to persistent data stores and wait for Platform Operations to respond. With Fusion, Platform Operations setup persistent data services that are automatically provisioned the same way compute services are automated natively by OpenShift.

#### Data Resilience

Platform Operations must offer application owners a range of options to ensure data is always available during disruptive events or system failures. Fusion provides the greatest resilience and application availability with comprehensive options for failover, recoverability, granularity, and speed.

#### Data Security

Platform Operations must also offer data encryption, retention, and recovery protection from unintentional data loss or intentional malware and ransomware. Fusion data security protects data with end-to-end encryption, backup and recovery with peace of mind from data loss risks and compliance demands. Fusion will add detection and orchestrated recovery when integrated with IBM Storage Defender future proofing cloud native applications for cyber resilience.

#### Data Mobility

Apps need to run from the edge, to core, to cloud; a key tenant of cloud native computing that requires applications and data to both be mobile. Application developers and Platform Operations are more productive with Fusion connecting their OpenShift applications and data together.

#### Data Cataloging:

Data scientists seeking a simple, fast way to create actionable data insights at scale. Fusion transforms the way data scientists implement metadata curation and data insight at scale with data visualization for massive unstructured data repositories.

### Positioning Statement

Companies are challenged to become more responsive to rapidly changing market conditions. They are striving to achieve digital transformation by deploying a cloud native approach built on containers and Red Hat OpenShift quickly and easily.
With limited IT resources and constrained budgets, businesses need simplicity, rapid deployment, consistency and dynamic scale while addressing automation through policy-driven security, data protection and provisioning.
IBM Storage Fusion makes Red Hat OpenShift easy to deploy and is a cost effective, simple to operate hybrid cloud managed platform. IBM Storage Fusion also provides a consistent experience from the edge, to core, to cloud infrastructure for all users.
For Fusion, the ELA profile would be clients who are using OpenShift as their Kubernetes Platform. Most Cloud Pak Customers, Maximo Customers, DB/2 Warehouse Customers would fit this profile
