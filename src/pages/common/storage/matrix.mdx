## Introduction 

It can be complex to work out which software customers are entitled to, or how to make sure a customer can get one of the products which dosen't appear in the high-level list of CSM focus software.<br/><br/>

This page aims to help demistify what's available to the customer and how it can be licensed. The list is current for 2024 CSM covered products.

Packages and products for CSM focus are listed in the columns, the products they contain are in the rows.
