## What is IBM Storage Suite for Cloud Paks and what does it do?

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
  IBM STORAGE SUITE FOR CLOUD PAKS IS EOM AND WILL BE DISCONTINUED IN 1Q2024
</InlineNotification>

**IBM Storage Suite for Cloud Paks (SS4CP)** Brings data services to container environments with a flexible, software-defined storage solution for hybrid cloud. IBM Storage Suite for IBM Cloud Paks provides the combined power of open source with Red Hat data services and award-winning IBM software-defined storage offerings designed to simplify the deployment of IBM Cloud Pak solutions while enabling a reliable and efficient storage foundation across your hybrid cloud. SS4CP is fully tested with Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Pak® solutions to provide enterprise data services to business-critical environments. It delivers a standardized and trusted approach for the deployment, use, monitoring and management of persistent storage for your OpenShift environment.

As its name implies, IBM Storage Suite for Cloud Paks is designed to complement and support the deployment and effective operation of IBM Cloud Pak solutions. The flexible elements in the suite are all software-defined solutions. They all can easily be implemented within legacy IT environments. They are all hardware agnostic and can run on any host with appropriate resources and performance. And the overall solution environments they create are deeply integrated with open-source components. These characteristics give IBM Cloud Pak solutions and the IBM Storage Suite supporting them great power and flexibility. There’s no vendor lock-in. There’s no need to forklift out legacy infrastructure and lose substantial investments. Instead, containerization can enable existing business applications to move where needed and operate in multiple new environments, both on-premises and in the cloud. IBM Cloud Pak solutions enrich basic container platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes with additional functionality to enhance, automate, and accelerate many tasks associated with developing, deploying, and maintaining cloud-native applications. Finally, IBM Storage Suite for IBM Cloud Paks provides a flexible menu of data management and data services that more transparently and comprehensively automate and enhance the integration of underlying storage and data management resources. Link to the [datasheet](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/AYDKODEG) here.

### IBM Storage Suite for Cloud Paks contains the following components:

  <ListItem>
    <strong>- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (OCS)</strong>: Offers
    container-native storage with highly available persistent block, file, or
    object storage.
    <br />
    <br />
  </ListItem>
</OrderedList>

**NOTE: IBM Storage Suite for Cloud Paks** (SS4CP) is a legacy offering not generally
available after 2022, to provision software defined storage for IBM Cloud Paks using
an entitled bundle of IBM Storage products capable of being deployed with OpenShift.
Customer requirements should in future be fulfilled using IBM Storage Fusion. IBM
Storage Suite for Cloud Paks was available in a standard edition at 2TB per VPC and
a capacity edition at 20TB per VPC. Component products were Red Hat OpenShift Data
Foundation, IBM Storage Scale, IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Storage Virtualize
for Public Cloud, Red Hat Ceph (object storage for the capacity edition), and some
variations included IBM Storage Protect Plus to provide a backup and restore capability.
SS4CP was frequently sold in ELA form and may still be entitled in customer deployments.
Customers should be encouraged to transition to IBM Storage Fusion which has advanced
OpenShift Data Foundation features, and more integrated backup and restore capabilities.

**Typical Use Cases include:**<br/>

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="General Purpose Storage">

#### The representative customer request:

Needs a simple storage solution for low capacity installation of a Cloud Pak which is reliable, easy to manage, and has a single point of support. The customer may be immature in their adoption of OpenShift and containers, so they want something that is suitable for the entire lifecycle from Proof of Concept to Production.

#### IBM Solution:

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) bundled with IBM Storage Suite for Cloud Paks provides block, file and object storage on OpenShift. ODF management and monitoring is integrated into the OpenShift console with the same user experience. Storage classes adopted during early deployment phases can be used reliably and securely in a production environment. Alternative and commonly adopted storage for proof of concept work such as NFS may be unsuitable for a robust and secure production deployment.

#### Customer benefit:

OpenShift Data Foundation is compatible with all Cloud Pak services and is simple to install and manage in a local deployment. The customer has a single point of support with IBM for their application and storage solution.
