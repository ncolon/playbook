## IBM's shift from Subscription to Enterprise Savings Plans for the IBM Cloud Catalog

There are different types of IBM Cloud Subscription options:
* IBM Cloud Subscriptions
* Enterprise Savings Plan (ESP)
* Cloud Native Subscriptions for IBM Cloud - bundles
* watson Subscription for IBM Cloud - bundles
* watsonx Subscription for IBM Cloud - bundles

From a client perspective, there is no difference:
* Enables a set of credits for the full catalog
* Provides a discount in return for a committed spend

The difference between these programs is the Seller compensation.

### Subscription plan

The IBM Sales team can order a Subscription Plan for IBM Cloud on behalf of the customer through SQO in DSW. With this plan, the customer signs up for a term (e.g. 1 year) on the IBM Cloud Platform and based on the term, they receive a corresponding percentage discount. To convert the subscription to a 3.0 subscription plan, a follow-up support ticket needs to be logged. Once converted to the subscription 3.0 plan, the discount is applied by BSS on the customer's total usage, including any overage. The customer is invoiced a fixed amount every month until their credits run out. After they consume all their credits, they are charged for the overage. If the customer has promotional credits on their account, then the promotional credits are applied after the discounts are applied. After the commitment term ends and if there is no renewal in place, the account is converted from a Subscription to a PAYGO without any discounts. Currently, this can be used to set up an Enterprise model but not a Distributor/Reseller model.

<AccordionItem title='Example - Subscription 3.0 plan'>

For example, the customer purchased the Subscription 3.0 Plan:<br/>
Amount: $6,000 for 6 months <br/>
Platform Discount: 10% <br/>
The customer received a promotion code for $100 per month for the first 3 months

| Subscription 3.0 | Actual usage ($) | Usage (less 10%) |	Promo ($) |	Invoice ($) | Starting credit ($) |	 Balance ($) |

### Enterprise Savings Plan (ESP)

A billing model for Cloud Platform and Support where the customer commits to spend an amount on the IBM Cloud Platform and based on that amount, they receive a corresponding percentage discount. This discount is applied to all their usage on that cloud platform account. The customer can sign up for 1 or more years of ESP, although their commitment is per year. ESP also supports ramps where the commitment increases every year. The customer is billed monthly based on their usage after discounts and other promotional credits are applied. The customer's monthly invoice is 1:1 with what they see on the billing and usage dashboard in their account in the IBM cloud console. If the customer is unable to fulfill their commitment by the end of their term, the last month's invoice contains the remaining unused commitment balance. An Enterprise Savings Plan order can be placed for a Direct Customer, an Enterprise Customer, or an End Customer who is part of a distributor/reseller channel.

<AccordionItem title='Support options with ESP'>

**Support with ESP:** The customer can purchase Advanced or Premium Support with their Platform ESP. Support is 10% of the platform commitment after the discount percentage. 
* Advanced support - Based on an ESP commitment of less than $24,000 per year on Cloud Platform. A minimum amount of $2,400 per year is added to their Advanced support commitment. 
* Premium support - Based on a commitment of less than $1,200,000 per year on Cloud Platform. A minimum amount of $120,000 per year is added to their Premium support commitment. 
Support is billed as 10% of their discounted cloud platform consumption.<br/>

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Discounts and promotions'>

**Discounts and promos:** If the customer has promotional credits on their account, then the promotional credits are applied after the discounts are applied. The promotional credits do not count towards their commitment. If the customer has signed up for a $10,000 commitment with a 10% discount and receives promotional credits for $1000, then they need to use $11,000 worth of services to fulfill their commitment. They still owe the commitment amount plus any overage they incur. The overage is also discounted at a commitment discount, which in this case is 10%.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title='Example - ESP with discount and promo'>

For example, a customer purchased an ESP:<br/>
Amount – $6,000 for 6 months <br/>
Platform Discount – 10% <br/>
The customer received a promotion code for $100 per month for the first 3 months.


| ESP| Actual usage ($) | Discounted usage ($) | Promo ($) | Invoice ($) | Starting balance ($) | Balance ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Month 1 |	900 |	810	 | 100	| 710	| 6000	 | 5290 |
| Month 2 |	1000 |	900	 | 100 | 	800 |	5290 | 4490 |
| Month 3 |	1000 |	900	 | 100	 | 800	 | 4490	 | 3690 |
| Month 4 |	1000 |	900	| 0	 | 900	 | 3690 | 2790|
| Month 5 |	1500	| 1350	 | 0	| 1350	 | 2790  | 1440 |
 |Month 6 |	2000 |	1800	 | 0	 | 1800 | 	1440  | 0 |
| Total Paid |	|  |  | $6,360   |            |        |	

In the following example, the customer has a remaining commitment balance that is applied to the last month's invoice.

| ESP| Actual usage ($) | Discounted usage ($) | Promo ($) | Invoice ($) | Starting balance ($) | Balance ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Month 1 |	900 |	810	 | 100	| 710	| 6000	 | 5290 |
| Month 2 |	800 |	720 | 100 |  620 |	5290 | 4670 |
| Month 3 |	900 |	810 | 100	 | 710	 | 4670	 | 3960 |
| Month 4 |	850 |	765 | 0	 | 765 | 3960 | 3195 |
| Month 5 |	800	| 720	 | 0	| 720	 | 3195 | 2475 |
 |Month 6 |	900 |	810	 | 0	 | 810 | 2475  | 1665 |
 | Remaining commitment | | | | 1665 | | |
| Total Paid |	|  |  | $6,000   |            |        |
