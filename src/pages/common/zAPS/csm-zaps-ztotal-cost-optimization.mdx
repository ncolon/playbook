## Overview
It is important to include as many aspects as possible to ensure any cost comparison is accurate. There are 4 main dimensions to think about. Typically costs analysis are done with only one or possibly part of 2 dimensions. This leads to inaccurate comparisons.

## Client scenarios

## Churn, totally moving off Z
**Scenario**: Customer is completely moving off z and going to save money

  * **Infrastructure Origin**: Any Z Machine
  * **Destination Infrastructure**: Distributed/Cloud
  * **Operating System**: z/OS or any flavor of the mainframe operating system

**IBM Solution**: Advises client that the OPEX costs will be minimally 30% greater on x86 on prem, and 70% greater on the public cloud.(1) (2)

** Externally approved claims**

* (1) https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cpo/research-insights/claims
* 30% increase in OPEX after moving applications on IBM Z to x86
* (2) https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/cpo/research-insights/claims
* Tailored Fit Pricing versus public cloud OpEx

**CSM Role(s)**: Educate the customer that moving off of z will not save money

**CSM Engagement**:

* White board 4 dimensions of TCO to highlight missing components in the customers analysis.
* Offer a no charge customized TCO analysis with the customers input and engagement from the IT Economics team

**IT Economics team**: Contact IT Economics team (IT.Economics@us.ibm.com)

**Badge**: CSM’s should obtain the TCO badge listed here: <a href="https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/ibm-systems-total-cost-of-ownership-tco">https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/ibm-systems-total-cost-of-ownership-tco</a>.  This will help educate the CSM on understanding cross platform costs.

## Churn, one or more applications moving off z
**Scenario**: Customer is moving one or more applications off z and going to save money
  * **Infrastructure Origin**: Any Z Machine
  * **Destination Infrastructure**: Distributed/Cloud
  * **Operating System**: z/OS or any flavor of the mainframe operating system

**IBM Solution**: Advises client that the OPEX savings are not linear.  In some cases OPEX can go up when applications are moved off.

**Understanding z/OS costs**: <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/679661638615">https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/679661638615</a>

**CSM Role(s)**: Educate the customer that moving applications of z/OS does not generate a linear savings

**CSM Engagement**:
* White board 24 hour usage.
* Explain how capacity is not reduced linearly and thus cost savings is not linear.
* Offer a no charge customized TCO analysis with the customers input and engagement from the IT Economics team

## New revenue loss, applications are slated for x86
**Scenario**: Customer is slating new workloads on x86 and not z to save money
  * **Infrastructure Origin**: Any Z Machine
  * **Destination Infrastructure**: Distributed/Cloud
  * **Operating System**: z/OS or any flavor of the mainframe operating system

**IBM Solution**: Advises client that the OPEX costs will be minimally 30% greater on x86 on prem, and 70% greater on the public cloud.(1) (2)

**Understanding z/OS costs**: <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/679661638615">https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/679661638615</a>

**CSM Role(s)**: Educate the customer that moving applications on z/OS does not generate a linear increase in costs and possibly can in fact be run in white space.

**CSM Engagement**:
  * White board 24 hour usage.
  * Explain how capacity is not reduced linearly and thus cost savings is not linear.
  * Offer a no charge customized TCO analysis with the customers input and engagement from the IT Economics team
