**What are the pain points that IBM Automatic Binary Optimiser for z/OS addresses?**

<aside>

**Pain point:** Complex and time-consuming manual optimization: Traditional manual optimization methods can be complex, time-consuming, and require specialized skills, which can be a challenge for organizations with limited IT resources.

**Pain point:** Inefficient use of resources: Without optimization, applications can consume excessive amounts of memory and CPU, leading to higher costs and reduced performance.

**Pain point:** Limited optimization options: The range of optimization options available with traditional methods may be limited, making it difficult to achieve the desired performance improvements.

**Pain point:** Lack of visibility into application performance: Traditional methods may not provide the visibility needed to identify performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the code.

**Pain point:** Maintenance overhead: Regular maintenance and optimization of applications can be a significant ongoing effort, especially for organizations with multiple applications and large codebases.

By using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, IBM Automation Binary Optimizer for z/OS addresses these pain points by automating the optimization process, reducing the effort and expertise required, and delivering significant performance improvements with minimal changes to the code.
