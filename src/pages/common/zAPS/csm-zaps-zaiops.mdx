## Software infrastructure

**Accelerate the journey to AIOps**
Assess how problems are resolved today and help identify a better way of resolving problems faster to reduce business impact
Determine specific business outcomes and objectives for AIOps and set expectations and  measurable ROI

**A holistic approach to AIOps that includes IBM Z**
You cannot successfully adopt AIOps in pieces or silos. It requires a holistic approach focused on business processes and workflows. The resiliency of a workflow depends on the health of every link in the chain. To succeed, you need visibility and insight throughout the entirety of the workflow.

## Detect
Monitor hybrid infrastructure and applications and detect issues and anomalies

The goal of the AIOps Detect capability area is to identify issues as soon as possible - ideally before they disrupt your business

**Objectives**
* Monitor complete infrastructure and end-to-end hybrid application performance
